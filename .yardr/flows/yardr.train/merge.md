summary: A conflict between the train's branch and `main` is resolved.

A conflict between the train's branch and `main` is resolved here: rebasing
`yard/<train>` onto `main` conflicted, in `open` or in `approved`. The train
was already integrated, or reviewed and approved; the job is only to make it
apply on top of what landed since, keeping the intent of both sides.

The work is on the train's own branch, `yard/<train>`, in the train's worktree,
rebased onto `main`. The conflict is between the train as a whole and what
landed on `main`, so read its children's beads for its side. Do not push
`yard/<train>`: the integrator pushes it, with a lease.

Before the train leaves as `done`, the branch is rebased onto `main` and the
landing test command passes on it (`YARDR_LANDING=1 sh .yardr/test`). The
command runs the selection plus the six black-box suites when compiled
content changed, and the plain selection alone when nothing compiled
changed (docs/line.md, "The landing run, and the whole suite on a quiet
machine"). One note on the train begins exactly `merge re-review:`. It lists
the old tip (`old tip: <sha>`), every conflicting file, what each side wanted,
how both were kept, and the test result.

Outcomes:

- `done`: the above holds. The train goes back to `open`, not to review: the
  integrator rebases it again (a no-op unless `main` moved again), tests it,
  pushes it and opens or updates its pull request before it goes to review.
- `rework`: both intents cannot be kept (`main` removed what the train builds
  on, or the two changes contradict each other), or the conflict is too large
  to judge with confidence. The rebase is aborted and the note says what
  conflicts and why it cannot be merged mechanically. The train goes back to
  `open`; the rework is a new child the yardmaster files, so make the note
  concrete enough to be a bead.
- `question`: the resolution needs a real design choice, which a person must
  make. The rebase is aborted, the note has the question and the options, and
  the train goes to `decide`.
