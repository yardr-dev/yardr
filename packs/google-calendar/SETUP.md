# Setting up Calendar

The pack wires Calendar into the yard as the declared source
`google-calendar`: events listed and read, the calendars listed, timed
events created and edited without inviting anyone. Each call goes out
with a
short-lived token minted from a gws login on this machine, so no new
copy of a secret is stored anywhere. The login, the account, the mint
and calling as a user are the four google packs' shared setup, said
once in `docs/google.md`.

1. **The gws login.** It needs the Calendar scope,
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`, else the calls come
   back 403. The shared login instructions in `docs/google.md` show
   how to check and add the `calendar` service while keeping the
   other applied packs' scopes.
2. **The pack.** It declares the source and nothing else. Have a crew
   member ask for it, and approve its card, in footplate or in
   `yardr chat` (`ctrl+o`); a person applies the packs they want,
   one card each:
   ```sh
   yardr bead ask <bead> "Add the Calendar source?" --run "pack apply google-calendar" --context "The pack declares the google-calendar source and nothing else; the card carries its declaration whole."
   ```
   By hand it is the operator's to type:
   ```sh
   yardr pack apply google-calendar
   # applied pack google-calendar to the yard: 1 created, 0 changed, 0 unchanged
   # source google-calendar is declared: 5 calls under https://www.googleapis.com (yardr source show google-calendar)
   ```
3. **The account.** Give the yard's Google account for
   `google-calendar`, one card, as described in `docs/google.md`
   (step 3).
4. **The mint.** Install the shared `google-mint` and set it on
   `google-calendar` as described in `docs/google.md`. What it needs
   and refuses is there too.
5. **The grants.** A pack of kind source asks none at import, so what
   a crew member may call is granted now: `read` for every read call,
   each update by its name. Plain, a crew member asks and the operator
   approves — one card per grant. For a crew member called
   `yardmaster`:
   ```sh
   yardr bead ask <bead> "Let the yardmaster read Calendar" --run "source grant google-calendar read --crew yardmaster" --context "The yardmaster lists and reads calendar events to work beads; the card names each call it covers."
   yardr bead ask <bead> "Let the yardmaster create Calendar events" --run "source grant google-calendar create --crew yardmaster" --context "Timed events on the yard's calendar; no invitations go out."
   yardr bead ask <bead> "Let the yardmaster edit Calendar events" --run "source grant google-calendar edit --crew yardmaster" --context "Changes only the fields it names; no invitations go out."
   ```
   By hand they are the operator's to type:
   ```sh
   yardr source grant google-calendar read --crew yardmaster
   yardr source grant google-calendar create --crew yardmaster
   yardr source grant google-calendar edit --crew yardmaster
   ```
   As ada, the same grants with `--as ada`, on cards addressed to
   ada and approved by ada alone: the shared card is in
   `docs/google.md` ("Calling as a user"), one card per grant, with
   `read`, `create` and `edit` from above. There is no typed way beside
   these: a grant `as` ada is ada's to give.
   `yardr source show google-calendar` lists each call with its kind
   and who may make it, plain and `as` each user.
6. **Check it.** The calendar source's check call lists the
   calendars, minted and live:
   ```sh
   yardr source check google-calendar
   # google-calendar: credential: GOOGLE_ACCOUNT is set in /Users/me/.yardr/sources/google.env, minted, good until 16:59
   # google-calendar: check call calendars (GET /calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList): 200 in 412ms, 1834 bytes
   ```
7. **Try it.** As the operator, who may make any call: the calendars,
   this week's events, one event read, an event created:
   ```sh
   yardr call google-calendar calendars
   yardr call google-calendar events calendarId=primary timeMin=2026-10-20T00:00:00Z timeMax=2026-10-27T00:00:00Z maxResults=10
   yardr call google-calendar event calendarId=primary eventId=<an id the listing showed>
   yardr call google-calendar create calendarId=primary summary="Lunch with Ada" start=2026-10-24T12:00:00+02:00 end=2026-10-24T13:00:00+02:00 location="Cafe Roma"
   ```
   An edit changes only what it names; what it leaves out stays:
   ```sh
   yardr call google-calendar edit calendarId=primary eventId=<an id> location="Cafe Novo"
   ```
   Every call names its calendar: `primary` is the account's own.
   Times are RFC 3339 with their zone, and the event created or
   edited invites no one: no invitation goes out of the yard.

Calling as a user — the yard reading another person's calendar with
their own credential — is the shared setup too: `docs/google.md`
has it.

What is not there, on purpose: inviting anyone (no attendees, and
sendUpdates is none); moving or deleting an event; all-day events
(a date without a time); sharing a calendar; paging past the first
page; and no call the pack does not list. The yard's source format
cannot express what is not listed, and the pack does not change
yardr.
