# Setting up PostHog

The pack wires PostHog into the yard as the declared source `posthog`:
an agent reads it through `yardr call` (HogQL queries, error tracking
issues, session recordings, a session's Replay Vision observations),
and webhooks hear a new error issue, and footplate feedback. Two calls
write: the destination, made once by the hook card, and an issue's
status, resolved when the bead fixing it lands; assigning an issue
stays in PostHog's pages.

1. **A personal API key.** In PostHog, your user settings → Personal API
   keys (Settings → Personal API keys,
   `https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#personal-api-keys`, or
   `https://eu.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#personal-api-keys` on
   EU Cloud): create one with the scopes `query:read`,
   `error_tracking:read`, `error_tracking:write`, `user:read`,
   `session_recording:read`, `replay_scanner:read`, `hog_function:read`
   and `hog_function:write`, for the queries, the issues and resolving
   them, the check, the recordings, the observations, the register check
   and the destination below. Resolving an issue needs
   `error_tracking:write`; the reads and the hook work without it. The
   yard sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`, read from the variable
   `POSTHOG_API_KEY`, the name and never the value.
2. **The project id.** In PostHog, the project's settings → Project ID
   (`https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#variables`, or
   `https://eu.posthog.com/settings/project#variables` on EU Cloud):
   the number, which every call below takes as `project`.
3. **Apply the pack.** As the operator:
   ```sh
   yardr pack apply posthog
   # source posthog is declared: 9 calls under https://us.posthog.com (yardr source show posthog)
   ```
4. **Give the yard the key.** No file is written by hand: the command
   asks for the key and shows nothing as it is typed or pasted, and the
   yard's server writes it to a file only you can read
   (`~/.yardr/sources/posthog.env`).
   ```sh
   yardr source key posthog           # POSTHOG_API_KEY, the personal API key: the operator's to give
   ```
   Or have a crew member ask for it, and answer on its card, in
   footplate or in `yardr chat` (`ctrl+o`), where the field shows dots:
   ```sh
   yardr bead ask <bead> - --secret posthog <<'ASK'
   PostHog's personal API key
   Settings → Personal API keys, scopes query:read, error_tracking:read, error_tracking:write, user:read, session_recording:read, replay_scanner:read, hog_function:read, hog_function:write.
   ASK
   ```
   The key goes nowhere else: not into mail, chat, a bead or a pack.
5. **Grant the calls and test them.** Reading is the operator's to
   grant, every read call with `read`:
   ```sh
   yardr source grant posthog read --group builders
   yardr source check posthog
   # posthog: check call whoami (GET /api/users/@me/): 200 in …ms, … bytes
   # posthog: email: <the key owner's address>
   ```
   In a session of a granted group, with the project id from step 2:
   ```sh
   yardr call posthog issues project=<id>
   yardr call posthog issue project=<id> id=<an issue's id>
   yardr call posthog query project=<id> hogql="select event, count() from events group by event order by count() desc limit 10"
   yardr call posthog recordings project=<id>
   yardr call posthog recording project=<id> id=<a session's id>
   yardr call posthog observations project=<id> session_id=<a session's id>
   ```
   The issues come 25 by default (`limit`, at most 100, `offset` pages);
   the list takes no status filter, so every status comes back. A query
   answers its columns and rows; PostHog refuses `OFFSET` on API keys,
   so page on `timestamp` instead. The recordings come 50 by default
   (`limit`, at most 50, `after` pages with the previous answer's
   `next_cursor`); `person_uuid`, `session_ids` (a JSON list, such as
   `["<a session's id>"]`), `date_from` and `date_to` narrow them.
   An issue's sessions come through `query`: every `$exception` carries
   its issue's id, so one query names the sessions behind an issue:
   ```sh
   yardr call posthog query project=<id> hogql="select distinct properties.\$session_id from events where event='\$exception' and properties.\$exception_issue_id='<an issue's id>'"
   ```
   Then `observations` reads what PostHog already wrote about one of
   those sessions in words, and the replay link is where a person
   watches it:
   ```sh
   yardr call posthog observations project=<id> session_id=<a session's id>
   # https://us.posthog.com/project/<id>/replay/<a session's id>
   ```
   (`?t=<seconds>` starts the replay at an offset.) Observations exist
   only for sessions a Replay Vision scanner has run on: a summarizer
   scanner is set up in PostHog, where running it costs PostHog
   credits, and reading what it wrote costs nothing here. The pack
   never asks PostHog to run one.
6. **The hook and its destination.** The yard registers the destination
   itself: a crew member asks for the hook, and the operator approves the
   card, giving the project id from step 2 in the clear. The yard makes
   the signing secret, keeps it in the hook's file, and makes the
   destination in PostHog from the webhook template, enabled, firing on
   a new error issue alone. The card needs the yard's public hook
   address first (`yardr settings set hook_public_url
   https://<host>/hooks`).
   ```sh
   yardr bead ask <bead> - <<'ASK'
   Q: Hook PostHog's new error issues up?
   C: The yard makes the signing secret and the destination in PostHog; the card needs the project id.
   R: hook add posthog --source posthog
   ASK
   yardr bead answer <bead> <ask> --approve --value project=<id>
   # hook posthog saved: POST /hooks/posthog (posthog); registered with POST /api/projects/{project}/hog_functions/ at https://us.posthog.com (201)
   ```
   If the approval's answer is lost, approving again first lists what
   stands and adopts the destination already aimed at the hook instead
   of making another.
   Removing the hook later removes nothing in PostHog: delete the
   destination in error tracking's alerting settings too.
7. **Without the destination's write scope, by hand.** Where the
   operator will not give the key `hog_function:write`, step 6's card
   cannot register,
   and the secret and the destination are made by hand instead. The
   reads above work either way. Make the secret first: PostHog holds
   whatever the destination is given, and the yard keeps the same in
   the file the hook names, so make one and put it in both places. A
   new file takes its mode from the shell's umask, so narrow it first.
   Each command below is one thing to type, in a block of its own:
   ```sh
   umask 077
   ```
   ```sh
   openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=' > ~/.yardr/posthog.secret
   ```
   ```sh
   chmod 600 ~/.yardr/posthog.secret
   ```
   ```sh
   yardr hook add posthog --source posthog --secret-file ~/.yardr/posthog.secret
   # hook posthog saved: POST /hooks/posthog (posthog)
   ```
   Then the destination, in PostHog: Error tracking → Configuration →
   Alerting → New notification → Go back to traditional editor (under
   "Need more control?"), and pick "HTTP Webhook on issue created" —
   the webhook template with the issue-created filter already set, not
   the plain "HTTP Webhook", which never fires on it. On its page:
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://<public host>/hooks/posthog` — the path
     ends in the hook's name, the one `yardr hook add` was given above.
   - **JSON Body**: the default names the event and the person but no
     project, so add the project beside them:
     ```json
     {"event": "{event}", "person": "{person}", "project": "{project}"}
     ```
   - **Secret headers**: add `X-Yardr-Secret` with the secret made
     above. The destination sends this header as-is; the yard verifies
     it instead of a signature. Secret headers, not Headers: a secret
     stays encrypted and out of the logs there.
   - **Method** stays POST, and **Filters** already match the
     issue-created event (`$error_tracking_issue_created`) alone: the
     yard hears a new issue, not a reopened or spiking one. Leave them.

   Create & Enable. Then prove the issue path before a real issue
   arrives: on the destination's page open Testing (Start testing)
   and replace the `event` object in the globals editor with an
   issue-created event, leaving the rest of the globals as shown:

   ```json
   {
     "uuid": "<a fresh uuid>",
     "event": "$error_tracking_issue_created",
     "distinct_id": "<a fresh uuid>",
     "timestamp": "2026-10-23T12:00:00.000000+00:00",
     "properties": {
       "name": "PostHog destination test issue",
       "description": "Sent from the destination's Testing panel; not a real issue.",
       "exception_props": {
         "$session_id": "<a fresh uuid>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Make each uuid fresh (`uuidgen`): the delivery id is the event's
   uuid, so a second run with the same one is kept as a retry of
   the first. Leave Make real HTTP requests on, and Test function:
   the destination POSTs the pasted event through the JSON body
   above, the hook answers 200, and a subscription with `--where
   type=error_issue` hears it, with the session and its replay link
   in its fields. It arrives as a genuine error_issue event — that
   is the point — marked as a test only by its name and
   description. If the panel reports the function was skipped, the
   pasted event did not match the destination's filters. A bare
   Test function without the paste proves only the URL and the
   secret: its example event is a `$pageview`, which the yard
   records as type `event`.

   The panel posts whatever globals the editor holds, and the test
   run delivers them when they match the destination's filters,
   with a real fetch while mocking is off (checked against PostHog
   at f1c6477, 23 Oct 2026:
   frontend/src/scenes/hog-functions/configuration/HogFunctionTest.tsx
   and hogFunctionTestLogic.tsx, whose test form defaults
   mock_async_functions to false; nodejs/src/cdp/cdp-api.ts,
   postFunctionInvocation and buildHogExecutorAsyncOptions;
   products/cdp/backend/api/hog_function.py, which names the
   globals "Mock global variables available during test
   invocation"; posthog.com/docs/cdp/destinations/
   customizing-destinations for the `{event}` template).

   If you later give the key the destination's write scope and add the
   hook through step 6's card instead, delete this destination first:
   the card adopts
   a destination already aimed at the hook's URL, and a hand-made one's
   secret is not the hook's.
8. **Hear new issues, and file beads for them.** A subscription hears
   them in an inbox:
   ```sh
   yardr subscribe <hearer> posthog --scope all --where type=error_issue
   ```
   When the delivery carries the triggering exception's session, the
   event's fields carry the session and its replay link beside the
   project, for a subscription's `--where` to name. A makes line on the
   hook files a bead for each new issue instead, with the issue's title,
   its description and a link to it. `hook add` replaces the definition,
   so the secret file is given again — the hook's own, which `yardr hook
   show posthog` names (with step 6's card the yard made it; with step
   7's fallback it is `~/.yardr/posthog.secret`) — and the line names the
   depot, since the event names no repository:
   ```sh
   yardr hook add posthog --source posthog --secret-file <the hook's file> --makes "action=created event=error_issue -> task:new@<depot>"
   # hook posthog saved: POST /hooks/posthog (posthog)
   # its events make a bead for a thread none tracks:
   #   action=created event=error_issue -> task:new@<depot>
   ```
9. **Hear footplate feedback, and read it.** Beside the
   issue destination, a second webhook destination in the same EU
   project hears the `survey sent` events footplate's Feedback button
   sends as answers to the API-type survey 'footplate feedback' (one
   open-text question). The yard does not register this one: the hook
   card's register stays the error-issue destination's alone, and the
   operator makes the feedback destination by hand, aimed at the same
   hook. In PostHog: Data pipelines → Destinations → + New →
   Destination, search "Webhook" and + Create — the plain "HTTP
   Webhook", which fires on whatever event its filters match. On its
   page:
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://<public host>/hooks/posthog` — the
     same hook as step 6's, the path ending in the hook's name.
   - **JSON Body**: the same body as the issue destination, so the
     event arrives with its properties and the project beside them:
     ```json
     {"event": "{event}", "person": "{person}", "project": "{project}"}
     ```
   - **Secret headers**: add `X-Yardr-Secret` with the hook's
     secret — the file `yardr hook show posthog` names (with step
     6's card the yard made it; with step 7's fallback it is
     `~/.yardr/posthog.secret`). Secret headers, not Headers: a
     secret stays encrypted and out of the logs there.
   - **Method** stays POST, and under **Match event and actions**
     select `survey sent` alone: the yard hears every survey
     response and reads only its own survey's, by the id in the
     line below.

   Create & Enable. (Checked 28 Oct 2026 against
   posthog.com/docs/data-pipelines/destinations/webhook,
   posthog.com/docs/surveys/destinations and
   posthog.com/docs/surveys/implementing-custom-surveys, and at
   posthog/posthog 86ba897:
   nodejs/src/cdp/templates/_destinations/webhook/webhook.template.ts —
   the "HTTP Webhook" template's inputs, their defaults, and secret
   headers sent as entered; the survey shape of a one-question
   capture, `$survey_id` with the bare `$survey_response`, and
   `$survey_response_<question id>` per question.)

   Then prove the feedback path before real feedback arrives: on
   the destination's page open Testing (Start testing) and replace
   the `event` object in the globals editor with a survey sent
   event, leaving the rest of the globals as shown:

   ```json
   {
     "uuid": "<a fresh uuid>",
     "event": "survey sent",
     "distinct_id": "<a fresh uuid>",
     "timestamp": "2026-10-28T12:00:00.000000+00:00",
     "properties": {
       "$survey_id": "<the feedback survey's id>",
       "$survey_response": "Sent from the destination's Testing panel; not real feedback.",
       "footplate_version": "0.0.0",
       "os": "test"
     }
   }
   ```

   Make each uuid fresh (`uuidgen`): the delivery id is the event's
   uuid, so a second run with the same one is kept as a retry of
   the first. Leave Make real HTTP requests on, and Test function:
   the destination POSTs the pasted event through the JSON body
   above, the hook answers 200, and the yardmaster subscription
   below (`--where type=feedback --where survey=<the feedback
   survey's id>`) hears it, with the version and the OS in its
   fields. It arrives as
   genuine feedback — that is the point — marked as a test only by
   its text. If the panel reports the function was skipped, the
   pasted event did not match the destination's filters.

   Each feedback delivery is heard through a subscription on its
   type and its survey, delivering to the yardmaster's inbox, with
   the feedback survey's id in the survey field — for this yard,
   the one mckean's mail names; it lives here, never in pack code:
   ```sh
   yardr subscribe yardmaster posthog --scope all --where type=feedback --where survey=<the feedback survey's id>
   ```
   Each feedback is an inbox line there, read as mail is read.
   Feedback is read, never filed: a makes line
   files no bead for feedback,
   because the yard files beads only for deliveries about a
   thread with a URL (`internal/dispatch/makes.go`), and a
   feedback submission carries its uuid alone, with no link made
   from it.

On EU Cloud the calls go to `https://eu.posthog.com` instead of
`https://us.posthog.com`: the pack declares both bases, and the yard
picks one by name, in step 3 (`yardr pack apply posthog --source-base
posthog=eu`, which a re-apply keeps) or any time after (`yardr source
set posthog base=eu`). The hook needs no such setting: the issue's and
the replay's URLs are built from the `project.url` the delivery carries,
on whichever host sent it.
