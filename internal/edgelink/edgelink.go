// Package edgelink is the yard's side of the edge (design
// yardr-hosted-050n): the service at https://my.yardr.dev that stands in
// front of yards. It holds what yardr edge connect does: fetch the edge's
// key, enrol this yard by a code a person approves in a browser, and ask
// the edge to forget the yard again. The edge's half is the router of the
// yardr-hosted repository; this package is its client and knows no more of
// it than the calls below.
//
// The yard has no key of the edge's until it has fetched one, and a request
// is signed to a named receiver key (yardkey.SignRequest), so the first
// step is the one that is not signed: GET /edge/key over HTTPS. That is
// trust on first use, as ssh has for a host key, with the web's
// certificates making the first use hard to intercept. Everything after it
// is signed with the yard's key and answered signed with the key that was
// fetched, so a different key at the same address, later, moves nothing.
//
// The calls, all under the edge's origin:
//
//	GET  /edge/key        the edge's public key as yardkey.Public writes it,
//	                      as plain text. Not signed.
//	POST /edge/enrol      {"key": <the yard's key>, "name": <its name>}.
//	                      Answered {"code", "expires"} (RFC 3339, shown to
//	                      the person and read as unknown if it is anything
//	                      else) while no one has
//	                      approved the yard at the edge's /connect page, and
//	                      {"handle", "email"} once someone has. The yard
//	                      calls again, signed anew, until the second, and is
//	                      answered the same code while its code is open.
//	POST /edge/disconnect {}: the edge forgets the row that names the yard's
//	                      key, and answers 200, or 404 if it had none.
//
// A request carries the yard's key, the time and the signature in the
// Yardr-Peer-* headers, as between peers. An answer carries its signature
// in Yardr-Peer-Signature, made with the edge's key over its status, the
// request's signature and its body (yardkey.SignResponse). An answer that
// is not so signed is anyone's, whatever it says. A refusal is a 4xx with
// {"refused": <reason>}, signed too.
