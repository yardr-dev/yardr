// Package store keeps the yard in a single bbolt file. One process owns it
// (bbolt locks the file); everything else reaches the yard through that
// process.
//
// Every write runs in one transaction that also appends its events, so the
// event log explains every step. Events carry a sequence number assigned in
// that transaction; subscribers resume from a sequence and are notified only
// after the commit succeeds.
//
// bbolt rules followed throughout: read transactions stay short (they pin
// pages), values are decoded (copied) before a transaction ends, and writes
// go through db.Batch so a burst shares one fsync. Batch may re-run a write
// function, so a function's only effects are inside its transaction;
// notification happens after the commit.
//
// The file is kept bounded. Past states of beads and deps are not retained:
// the event log is their history, and a "versions" bucket that once kept a
// full snapshot per change (read by nothing but a migration) is dropped on
// open. The log and the ended sessions are pruned by age (see Prune), the
// log never past what a running crew member has yet to read (within a bound)
// nor past the oldest live session, and a pruned file shrinks only when
// compacted (Compact) while no server holds it.
//
// Depots stored before depot kinds existed (git or dir) are stamped "git" on
// open (migrateDepotKinds): every depot until then was a repository. The
// stamp needs no schema bump, an older yardr reads past the field.
//
// Reads that serve one crew member or follow the log page through indexes
// written at ingest (inbox, events_by_kind) rather than scanning the log
// in one read transaction, and what needs the live sessions (a claim, the
// dispatcher's pass) reads them through an index of their own rather than
// every session ever stored. A listing that includes what is closed or
// ended takes the newest it was asked for, through the beads' keys or the
// sessions' index by start, and one bead's sessions through their index by
// bead (ListBeads, ListSessions).
