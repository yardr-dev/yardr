// The link move row of the run-ask list (runList): moving the yard's links
// from one source to another, for a yard whose source moved. It is the form
// of link move that names two sources and no issue; the form that moves one
// issue to another bead is anyone's (MoveLink) and needs no card. Moving
// links is the operator's alone (ActMoveLinks stands under ruleOperator and
// no site marks it Delegate), so no delegated run moves one: the yardmaster
// proposes the move and the operator approves it.
//
// The card shows the move by running the part of MoveLinkSource that reads
// and checks, as the move runs it (planLinkSourceMove), so it refuses what
// the move refuses and counts what the move moves. The approval is held to
// the links it counted and runs the move itself, in the write that records
// the approval.
//
// The row is registered here, beside its functions, and not in runList's
// literal: runask.go stands at the file-size ceiling the test gate holds
// (.yardr/test).
