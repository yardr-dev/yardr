// Asks are questions as data: one question with enumerable options, asked
// of one person, living as a note of kind ask on any bead in any stage.
// The person answers by picking an option, puts the question aside, or
// declines it, each a note of kind answer; so is the asker taking the
// question back (TakeBackAsk). Both are JSON in Note.Text, one schema each,
// parsed the same everywhere; prime, review and chat render them as
// numbered text, never the raw form.
//
// An ask holds the question in one line, who must answer, two to five
// lines of context, one or more options each naming its consequence in a
// line, the one recommended and why, and the other beads it is about. An
// ask with no options wants words. yardr adds the option "You decide" to
// every ask that has options; the writer does not write it.
//
// An answer names its ask by the ask note's seq and holds either a pick
// (the option's number with any words), words alone (only on an ask with
// no options), Later (put aside: not open for 24 hours or until the
// asker's next note on the bead, whichever is first), or Decline (ends it
// with no option picked). A newer pick supersedes the older one for
// display; every pick stays as a note. TakeBack is not the person's: the
// asker, or the operator, ends an ask that is asked no more, with why.
//
// An ask may ask for a secret instead (secretask.go): its answer is the
// names that were given, written by GiveSecret alone, and the value is in
// no note. Or it may propose a command of the operator's (runask.go): its
// answer is the command the yard ran, written by ApproveAsk alone.
