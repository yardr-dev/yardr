// A link can trust a name of the peer's yard as a user of this one
// (docs/peers.md, "Trusting a name as a person of this yard"): the operator
// says that mail from <name>@<peer> is that user speaking (Peer.Trust, yardr
// peer allow --trust). It is a grant on the link and about whose word what
// comes is, mail and answers both. The two are not one identity, the name
// gets none of the operator's powers, and nothing on the socket asks it:
// mail runs no command, and an answer is taken trusted or not. What it
// changes is one field of the mail that comes, as, which those who read
// the mail are shown ("as <user>") and told the meaning of (TrustedMail),
// and the mark an answer from that name carries in numbered text.
//
// A grant lasts while both its ends do. The user removed takes it along
// (untrust), and so does the peer once the roster it says has the name no
// more (distrust): whoever has either name next is trusted as nobody.
