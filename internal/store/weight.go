// weighs a card in the write that stores it, from the card it has just
// written and its own records, exactly as it writes a run ask's Does:
// never from the asker's words. The approval weighs it again in its own
// write, and a weight that differs from the one the card showed is stale:
// nothing runs, so no weighty card is approved from a card that did not
// show its weight. A card that narrows (a revoke, a lower limit, user rm,
// timer rm) is never weighty.
