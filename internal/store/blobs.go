// and a file (everything else). The yard keeps it in its home under
// BlobsDir, in a file named by the SHA-256 of its bytes, so the same
// bytes sent twice are one file and a letter names them by what they
// are. A blob is written once and never changed. The log has only the
// name (the files of a mail event, of a note its row), so the store file
// does not grow by the bytes; a blob nothing names any more goes with
// Prune, and nothing else removes one.
