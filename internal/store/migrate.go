package store

// The store's migrations, one file per migration.
//
// migrate_NNN_<name>.go holds the migration that brings schema NNN, where
// NNN is the version a store must be below for it to run: migrateChecks,
// which runs below 19, is migrate_019_checks.go. A migration whose bucket
// move runs before every other migration keeps both phases in its one file
// (migrate_011_crew.go, migrate_012_depots.go). migrate_<name>.go holds a
// one-time migration with no schema version, named after what it does.
// Three migrations live beside the area they migrate instead
// (migrateUserCursors, migratePeerSince, migrateOperator), and the index
// builds beside their indexes; all join the list where they run.
// openMigrations below is the whole upgrade in the order Open runs it.
// Only the migrations read the old words; what is given to this build is
// in today's words. The helpers two migrations share stay in this file.

// schemaVersion 19 has depots with a test command and nothing else that
// says how they are checked: the fields of a depot's record that named the
// command yardr itself ran before a bead landed (check, check_light,
// light_slot, allow_no_check) and the setting that bounded those runs
// (gate_slots) are gone (migrateChecks). A build before it runs yardr depot
// check, which would find a depot whose check was in the store with none.
// Version 18 has hooks that say what their source's events say of a
// bead (Hook.Says): until then the dispatcher's rules for its sources were
// Go. A build before it would drop the table from a hook it rewrites (hook
// add, a
// pack's import), and with it every move the events made. Nothing is
// migrated: a hook without a table moves no bead, and says so on each event
// about one (yardr hook add --says, or a pack's sources.<source>.says).
// Version 17 has sources that take updates: a source's record holds
// how many of a caller's calls in an hour may be updates
// (Source.UpdatesPerHour), and the key an update is sent with is kept until
// the service said it took it (the bucket source_keys, see updateKey). A
// build before it would drop the limit from a record it rewrites (source
// set, source add), so a source the operator had bound to fewer updates
// would be back at the default with nothing to say so, and its source rm
// would leave the keys behind. Nothing is migrated: a source without the
// setting has the default, and one without keys has no update under way.
// Version 16 has sources that sessions and crew members call: who the
// operator granted a source's calls is in a bucket of its own
// (source_grants, see GrantSource), and a source's record holds how many
// calls an hour one caller may make (Source.CallsPerHour). A build before
// it would drop the limit from a record it rewrites (source set, source
// add), so the source would be back at the default with nothing to say so,
// and its source rm would leave the grants behind: a source added again
// under the name would be open to whoever the old one was, with the yard's
// credential behind the call. Nothing is migrated: a source without grants
// is called by the operator alone, as before.
// Version 15 has what lands in a user's inbox told outside the yard:
// with a mail to a user and with a notification, a push is queued for the
// daemon to send (the bucket pushes, see Push), and the user's record holds
// how the last send ended and when the last ones went (User.LastPush,
// User.Pushed). A build before it would fill the inbox and queue nothing,
// so the person would not be told and nothing would say so, and it would
// drop the two fields from a record it rewrites, and with them the count
// that bounds an hour's messages. Nothing is migrated: what was in an inbox
// before is not told afterwards.
// Version 14 has users that are told outside the yard: a user's
// record holds the source that tells them and the path of the file their
// address is read from (User.Notify, User.EnvFile), which a build before it
// would drop from a record it rewrites, as it does when the user
// acknowledges their inbox. The person would then stop being told, with
// nothing to say so. Nothing is migrated: a user without them is told
// nowhere, as before.
// Version 13 calls a piece of a train a wagon. Version 10 to 12 of
// main, in no release, called it a car, and a yard that ran one has that
// type in beads and in all that names a type (migrateWagons). A build before
// it knows no wagon, so it would take one for a bead like any other: under
// the depot's default flow, and landing on the base by itself.
// Version 12 calls the repository or directory beads are worked in a
// depot: its records are in the bucket depots, where they were in rigs, and
// the field that names it in a bead, a route, a flow pointer, an imported
// pack and a peer's intake is depot, where it was rig
// (migrateDepotRecords), as is the word in what else the store held it in
// (migrateDepots). A build before it reads the old bucket and field only,
// so it would find a yard with no depots and beads that are in none.
// Version 11 calls the sessions that are always in a yard its crew:
// their records are in the bucket crew, where they were in residents
// (migrateCrewBucket), and the word is crew where the store held resident
// (migrateCrew). A build before it reads the old bucket only, so it would
// find a yard with nobody in it and make a second yardmaster.
// Version 10 calls work that lands as one a train and a piece of it a
// wagon: the bead types epic and part are train and wagon, in beads and in all
// that names a type (migrateTrains). A build before it knows only the old
// types, so it would take a train for a bead like any other: its children
// would branch from the depot's base and land there one by one.
// Version 9 calls the crew member that coordinates a yard its yardmaster:
// the setting that names it is yardmaster, where it was mayor
// (migrateYardmaster). A build before it reads the old key only, so it would
// not find the name and would write a second one beside it.
// Version 8 had an end to a held bead's wait: a peer's intake said how
// long a bead it sent waited to be released (hold_for), which a build
// before it would drop from a record it rewrites, as it does with every
// message it takes from the peer. An intake set to hold for ever would
// then have held for the default, and its beads gone back refused. Nothing
// was migrated, and nothing is now that a bead arrives unheld and the
// intake has no such time (docs/peers.md, "The intake").
// Version 7 has beads that are sent on from yard to yard: the record
// of a bead that came from a peer holds the yards it had passed through
// (peerBead.Path), which a build before it would drop from a record it
// rewrites, when the bead is released, say. Sent on after that, the bead
// would no longer say where it began, and the yard it began in would take
// it again: the loop the path is there to stop. Nothing is migrated: a
// record without a path is one whose bead came from its peer alone, and
// the beads sent out are in a bucket of their own (peer_beads_out).
// Version 6 has peers that send beads: a peer's record holds the
// intake its operator set for them (PeerIntake), which a build before it
// would drop from a record it rewrites, as it does with every message it
// takes from the peer. The beads would then be refused until the operator
// noticed. Nothing is migrated: the records of the beads themselves are in
// a bucket of their own (peer_beads), which an older build never opens.
// Version 5 has peers that can be renamed: a peer's record holds the
// names it had and the event it was added after (migratePeerSince), which
// a build before it would drop from a record it rewrites, and with them
// the mail from before a rename. Version 4 has users that subscribe: a
// user's record holds its subscriptions and a second cursor, for the
// notifications they make (migrateUserCursors), which a build before it
// would drop from a record it rewrites. Version 3 has the inbox and events_by_kind indexes, written
// with every event (migrateIndexes). Version 2 keys beads by UUID with handles
// (yard-29). Version 1 is every store before it: beads keyed by counter ids
// (yard-1) minted from the counters bucket, which no build after v0.4.0
// migrates (ErrCounterIDs).
//
// Bump this whenever a build starts writing something every write must
// keep up (an index, a field a read relies on): the stamp is what stops an
// older build from appending to the store without it.
