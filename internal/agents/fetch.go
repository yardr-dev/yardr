// Fetch is how a program gets onto a Mac that has no package manager and
// nobody at a terminal: one file its maker publishes, at one address, of one
// version, with the checksum it had when it was verified. yardr fetches
// nothing itself: this is data for a program that does (yardr doctor --json,
// yardr harness show --json; docs/doctor.md, "A program fetched on a Mac"
// says what such a program does with it, step by step).
//
// The version is pinned, and the checksum is yardr's, not read from the
// maker's site when the file is fetched: a checksum served beside a download
// shows that it is whole, not who made it, and what is fetched is then
// exactly what was verified. Every program here keeps itself current
// afterwards. So a Fetch changes only with a bead that verifies the new one
// again and says where from (Verified).
