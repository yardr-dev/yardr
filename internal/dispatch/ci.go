// CI is read as state, not taken from an event. A train a hook's table has
// a line for CI's result for, in the stage it is in (in-pr in yardr's own
// train flow: event=ci stage=in-pr), is judged on the required checks of the
// commit that was reviewed (pr_reviewed_sha, which pr-train stores as the
// train enters the stage), as the source reports them when the daemon asks:
//
//	green    every required check concluded success
//	red      a required check failed or timed out
//	pending  one is still running, was cancelled or has not reported: wait
//
// Green and red are put to the table as an event the daemon makes up, with
// the fields event=ci and conclusion=success or failure (ciEnvelope), and
// the line it matches names the outcome reported for the train, as for a
// hook event (github.go): done and changes, in yardr's own.
//
// The daemon asks when it first sees the train in the stage (so CI that finished
// during review, or while the daemon was down, is seen), and again when a
// hook event about the train's pull request arrives: an event says
// only that the state may have changed, never what it is. One green
// workflow among several required ones is therefore pending, and a run
// that is the first to finish moves nothing.
//
// What is required is the base branch's: its protection and its rulesets.
// A base that requires no check gives the daemon nothing to call green, so
// it lands nothing there and a human says merge; a failed check still
// sends the train back.
