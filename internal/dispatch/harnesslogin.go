// The yard leads a harness's login itself when a crew member sits at its
// login screen (yardr-302g). Design yardr-bwm2 3.5 had the yardmaster relay
// `yardr harness login <kind> --json` to the person, but the yardmaster is
// an agent of that harness, and it cannot start while the harness is logged
// out: on a hosted yard nobody led the first login, and mail to the
// yardmaster sat unread with nothing said of why.
//
// So the daemon leads it, with no agent in the loop. Its steps are asks of
// the yard's operator on the crew member's journal:
//
//  1. Which harness, and which of its methods: one option per method of
//     each kind installed here whose file has a login recipe, and one
//     "API key" option per kind whose file names a login_env. Nothing
//     runs until it is answered, so a person who does nothing sees this
//     one ask.
//  2. The pick starts the login leader, a child of the daemon on its own
//     binary, and answers its choose need with the method. Its open_url is
//     the link of the next ask; its input is a secret ask naming the wait
//     the leader registered (store.LoginWait), which GiveSecret answers in
//     the server's memory: the daemon never holds the value, and no note,
//     event, file or mail does. An API key pick instead asks for the key
//     as a secret ask, which GiveSecret writes into the operator's key
//     file of the kind (store.HarnessKeyFile): no leader runs, and no
//     login screen is read. Every session of the kind on the operator's
//     login reads that file as it starts (the runner), so the key reaches
//     what the machine's login does: the crew, the groups without
//     login_for and the operator's conversations. A session on another
//     user's login reads that user's file, which no ask writes yet.
//  3. Its confirm, the one call that proves the login, is an ask of its
//     own: it costs a model call on the person's account.
//  4. Done: every session of the kind sitting at its login screen is
//     restarted: a crew session as yardr crew restart does, and a bead
//     session ended as aborted, so its bead is routed again and a new
//     session starts on the login. A key's done is the same restart, on
//     the secret ask's answer, of the sessions on the operator's login
//     alone: the others read no key and would sit at the screen again.
//
// One login is led per kind at a time: the machine's login of a kind is
// every crew member's of that kind. A login that ends without one (the
// leader's own timeouts, a decline) takes its open ask back and is offered
// again on the next held nudge, mail that came after it ended, never on
// every pass.

// HarnessLoginAskKey is a handle key of the crew session a led login was
// offered for: the journal its asks are on, the ask it waits on and what
// step that ask is. A daemon that starts again finds its first ask here
// and waits on it again; an ask of a later step, whose leader went with
// the daemon, it takes back. Crew says the mark as login_led, and the store
