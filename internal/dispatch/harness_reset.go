// An agent whose harness stopped on a usage limit can do nothing until the
// window opens, and then needs no more than to be told: on 6 Oct 2026 the
// crew member brakeman stopped at 23:20 with a review waiting, its window
// opened at 00:02, and it sat until a person prompted it (yardr-m71s). The
// session_harness_error raised at the stop says when the window resets,
// where a source of the yard knows (harness_limits.go). So for a reset no
// more than harnessResetMax away, yardr keeps the time on the agent's handle
// and comes back for it:
//
//   - While a session waits, its idle spell is not counted (limits):
//     session_idle would fire at 30 minutes and a group with grace would end the session before the window opens.
//     max_age still applies. A crew member has no idle limit.
//   - While a session waits, its group starts no further session with the
//     model it waits with (holdBack, stall.go): each would stop on the same
//     limit, and three would wait where one does. Nothing is asked for it.
//   - At the wake the source is asked once more, since the time was the
//     provider's word hours ago. A window still used up is told of again,
//     as at the stop, with the later time: what the first event said no
//     longer holds. A provider that gives no answer does not hold the
//     prompt back; the time it gave has come.
//   - Then the agent is prompted, when the usage limit still ends its pane,
//     its input is empty and no first prompt is on its way: a session that
//     has done nothing gets its first prompt again, as one at capacity
//     does, and one stopped mid-work or a crew member gets resetLine, which
//     states the fact and no more. Each prompt is a session_harness_retry
//     and one of the HarnessRetries of the session's life.
//
// A prompt typed is not a prompt taken. Seen live at that reset: a harness,
// idle for 44 minutes with 198k tokens of context, answered the prompt with
// a menu of its own ("Cache expired, the next message re-sends the entire
// history: Compact and continue / Start a new session / Continue as-is"),
// drawn in place of its input, and kept the prompt behind it (which harness,
// and the menu as it drew it: harnesses/kimi.yaml). herdr still
// says idle, and the error may still be on the screen above. So harnessLook
// after the prompt yardr looks once (harnessTaken, crewPromptTaken): an
// agent that is working took it; one that is not, in whose pane the prompt
// does not show, did not, and that is told as a session_harness_error with
// `prompt_shown: false` and the pane's end. Nothing is typed again and no
// key is pressed: the menu is the harness's question to whoever runs it,
// its default costs a compaction, and an Enter of yardr's would choose it.
// For the same reason a crew member's nudges wait while its prompt has not
// shown. Where the prompt shows, an error that ends the pane below it
// stands again and is raised as any error is; one above it is the old one.
