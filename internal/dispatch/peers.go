// Messages between this yard and its peers (docs/peers.md) wait in the
// store, in an outbox for each peer, and the daemon is what carries them,
// as it makes the issue moves (issues.go) and for the same reasons: a call
// out of the yard is made outside the store's write, and every pass reads
// the outbox again, so a daemon restarted carries on with no state of its
// own.
//
// Only a peer with a URL is called. To it the daemon posts what waits, in
// order, and of it the daemon asks what waits there for this yard: a yard
// that cannot be called (a laptop behind a router) gets its messages by
// asking. A yard that can be called asks all the same, and is handed
// nothing: whether the other side has its URL is the other side's to know,
// and may change there.
//
// The posting is a pass's. The asking is not, under Run: the peer holds a
// question open until it has something to hand over, for up to PeerHold, so
// each peer is asked from a goroutine of its own (pulling), which asks
// again as soon as it is answered and wakes the loop for what came. A pass
// run alone (Reconcile) asks once itself, and is answered at once.
//
// A message may be posted twice (the daemon died between the peer's answer
// and the store's write): the peer takes an id once.
