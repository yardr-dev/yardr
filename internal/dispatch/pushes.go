// What lands in a user's inbox is told them outside the yard, through the
// source their record names (yardr user set <name> notify=<source>), and so
// is an ask for them, which stands in their queue. The store queues a push
// with the mail, the notification or the ask, in the same write
// (store.Push), so the inbox never waits for a source; sending is the
// daemon's, here, for the reasons issues.go gives for an issue's move: the
// call is outside the store's write, the daemon is what waits out a
// source's outage, and every pass reads the queue again, so a daemon that
// was down or replaced carries on with no state of its own.
//
// Per user and pass, one message: everything that is past the grace
// (store.PushGrace) and still unread, or for an ask still open. What the
// user acknowledged meanwhile is dropped without a word, which is what
// keeps a person who is reading along in yardr chat from being told of it a
// second time; so is an ask they answered, declined or put aside.
//
// The message was sent at most once when the source took it: the pushes
// are gone from the store with that answer. Should the daemon die between
// the answer and that write, the next pass sends it again: a person is
// then told twice, never not at all.
