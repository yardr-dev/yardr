// Screens as `herdr pane read --format ansi` gave them (herdr 0.9.0): the
// input of Claude Code 2.1.288 between its two rules, with a no-break space
// after the mark, and Codex's above an empty line and its footer. Each run
// of styled text begins with ESC[0m; lines end in CR LF.
//
// Kimi Code 2.1.1's is the brakeman's pane of 7 Oct 2026, narrowed: the
// input in its box, the cursor a space in reverse video, and the message it
// took above. The box that holds a draft is as Kimi drew one in a terminal
// of its own on the same day, its second line as it wraps a long one.
//
// Muse Code 1.4.9's is a pty read of 15 Oct 2026, narrowed: the input one
// line under a voice-input divider and above a rule and the footer, the
// mark coloured and no placeholder drawn, a message it took above with
// the same mark, and the line it works behind begun with ◆.
//
// Kiro CLI 2.25's is the idle pane of awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator's TUI
// fixtures, narrowed: the input under the status line, begun with ›, an
// empty one showing the placeholder in gray (not faint) with ↵ after it
// and the copy hint under it, a message it took above as a plain indented
// paragraph, and the line it works behind begun with › too.
