// Package source reads the declaration of a service outside the yard, one
// YAML file that names the service's address, the credential it takes and
// the requests the yard may make of it, and makes one such request (Do).
// A service is added by its file and no Go: what the file cannot say (a
// request that must be signed, an answer in pages, anything but JSON or a
// file upload over HTTPS) is not a declared source.
//
// One thing a file can say is no request: a command the yard runs. The
// command that tells what a harness kind's subscription still carries (the
// key limits) is the one that is run today; internal/limits runs it. A file
// with that key may have no calls at all. The thread and link keys say how
// the yard speaks in the source's threads and how its issues are a bead's
// link — thread's by one command per thing the yard does there, run by
// internal/hooks. The hook key says what the service sends in: how the
// core verifies its webhooks, and the command that turns a verified body
// into the envelope. The events key says what the source sends in about
// pull requests and CI, and the commands that read them back: the daemon
// judges CI runs against the pull request's head, and reads the pull
// request and its CI live when no event told what it needs. The git key
// names the credential helper git runs for the source's host, for a depot
// whose origin is there: the yard copies it with the declaration's other
// command files and never runs it.
//
// The file holds no secret. It names the variable the credential is in, and
// the value is read from a file of the yard's at each call, so a declaration
// can be kept in the store, shown and copied. A service whose address is its
// secret, a webhook URL, names the variable that holds the address
// (credential.url), and the file names no base.
