		Use:   "ask <id> <question> | ask --new <question> | ask --take-back <id> <ask> <reason>",
		Short: "Ask someone a question as data: options to pick, answered, put aside or declined, or taken back",
		Long: `Asks a person a question as data, on any bead in any stage: the question in
one line, who must answer, two to five lines of context, the options each
with its consequence in a line, the one recommended and why, and the other
beads it is about. The person answers by picking an option, puts the
question aside, or declines it (yardr bead answer); the answer is the
option, so it cannot be misread.

The ask is a note of kind ask; its text is JSON, one schema: question, to,
context, options (a label and a consequence each), recommend and why,
about. prime, review and chat render it as numbered text with the
recommendation marked and its state; nobody reads the raw form.

yardr adds the option "You decide" to every ask that has options; the
writer does not write it and cannot leave it out. Picking it records that
the person left the question to the asker, who decides and notes what it
took.

An ask with no --option wants words; it is answered with --words. An ask
needs --context (at least one line; write two to five) and a consequence
on every option, so the card is never empty; both are refused without.
--to defaults to the yard's operator. --recommend names an option's
number with --why saying why in a line; without them no option is
marked.

--to <person>@<peer> asks a person of a linked yard: the ask is stored on
the bead as any ask, and queued for the peer's yard in the same write,
where it stands among the person's decisions; their pick comes back onto
the bead. The link must carry asks out (yardr peer allow <peer> --send
ask). That is all a user of the yard needs; a crew member must be allowed
the peer as well (yardr crew set <crew member> peers=<peer>), and an
agent working a bead asks no other yard. The daemon delivers it, so the
command returns before it has arrived: yardr peer show <peer> lists what
still waits.

An ask for a user of this yard is also sent to each name of a linked yard
the operator gave reach for that user (yardr peer allow <peer> --reach
<name>@<peer>=<user>), whoever asks: it stands among their decisions there
too, and the answer from there lands on the bead as one given here does.
The command names where it was queued for.

--secret <source> asks the operator for the credential of a declared
source: an API key or a token, never a login. The ask says where its
answer goes and the answer is no words: the person types the value where
nothing shows it (yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --secret), the yard's server
writes it into the file the source's credential is read from, and the
answer on the bead holds the names that were given and never the value. So
the value is in no note, event, mail, brief or pane; an agent that needs a
key asks for it this way and never has the person paste it. The names are
what the source needs given: the mint's inputs where the declaration names
a mint (credential.mint), else every variable of its credential; the mint's
names and the static ones are alternatives, not all required, so a minted
token is never asked for. --env narrows the ask to any names the
declaration has. The asker names no path and invents no name. --context
says where the person gets the value. The card's line "a
secret: <names>, for the source <source> (<where its calls go>)" is the
yard's, from the declaration, whatever the question says.

A secret ask takes no --option, --recommend or --about. It is refused, and
nothing is stored, for a source the yard does not have (the operator adds
it: asking gives the asker nothing), for one whose declaration names no
credential, for --to anyone but the operator, and for --to <person>@<peer>:
nothing of a secret crosses a link, and no copy goes to a linked yard.

--secret <source> --for-user <user> asks for that user's own address in a
source that tells people instead: the one variable the source's notify key
names (notify.address.env), which the yard
reads from the user's env_file at each send. It is asked of the user, which
is where --to then defaults, or of the operator for them, and of nobody
else. The value typed goes into the user's env_file, or with none set into
~/.yardr/users/<user>.env, which is then set as yardr user set sets it. It
is --for-user beside --secret because the source still names the variable
and where the value is sent, and the user only whose file it is kept in.
Giving it does not say the user is told through the source: the card and
the answer name the command that does (yardr user set <user>
notify=<source>). It takes no --env, and is refused for a source with no
notify key and for a user the yard does not have.

--secret <source> --for-crew <crew member> asks for that crew member's own
credential in the source, which a reply answers with: what --secret takes
(the mint's inputs where the declaration names a mint, else every variable
of its credential), which --env narrows to any names the declaration has.
The value typed goes into the crew member's env_file, or
with none set into ~/.yardr/crew/<name>.env, which is then set as yardr
crew set sets it. The crew member's running session does not see the new
value: it takes effect when it next starts (rotation or yardr crew restart
<name>), as the card and the answer say. It is --for-crew beside --secret
because the source still names the variables, and the crew member only
whose file they are kept in. It is asked of the operator only, and is
refused for a crew member the yard has not and for a source with no
credential. A crew member with an env_command as well keeps both: the
env_file line is the one written, and for a name both set the command's
value is what its session runs with.

--secret <source> --as <user> asks for that user's own credential in the
source, which a call made as them reads: every name under credential.mint
where the declaration names a mint, else the static ones (credential.env,
and credential.update_env where it names one), which --env narrows to any
name the declaration has. The value typed goes into the user's env_file,
or with none set into ~/.yardr/users/<user>.env, which is then set as
yardr user set sets it. It is --as beside --secret because the source
still names the variables, and the user only whose file they are kept in
and whose calls read them. It is asked of the user, which is where --to
then defaults, or of the operator for them, and of nobody else. It is
refused for a source with no credential and for a user the yard does not
have. It is not --for-user: that asks for the user's own address in a
source that tells people, and this for the credential a call made as them
reads; a source may have both to ask for.

--secret-login <login> asks the operator for the input of the harness login
that waits under that reference: the login its leader's input need names.
The value typed goes to the waiting login and is kept nowhere, not even in
the answer, which holds the names as any giving does. It is asked of the
operator, takes no --env, no --for-user, no --for-crew and no --as, and is
refused when no login waits under the reference at the giving. The
yardmaster asks one per input need of a login it relays.

--secret-hook <hook> --source <source> asks the operator for the signing
secret of the hook <hook> of the declared source <source>: the value the
service signs its webhooks with, pasted from where the service shows it.
The yard's server writes it to the file it owns for the hook,
<home>/hooks/<hook>.secret (mode 0600), which the hook then names; the
value is in no note, event, mail, brief or pane, as for --secret. It is
asked of the operator, takes no --env, no --for-user, no --for-crew and
no --as, and is refused for a source the yard does not declare, one whose
declaration has no hook key, and a hook the yard has already. The hook
itself is a second
ask on the same bead (--run "hook add <hook> --source <source>"), asked
after this one: the operator gives the secret first, then approves the
hook, whose approval runs only with the secret standing in its file.

--run "<command>" proposes one yardr command that is the operator's to
give, for the operator to approve: a crew member that needs it asks this
way instead of mailing the person a line to paste into a terminal. The
command is written as it is typed, with or without the leading yardr, and
is one of the list the yard runs from a card:

  peer allow <peer> --send <kinds> | --receive <kinds> | --mail-limit <n>
      the link carries mail and ping each way, or takes more mail in an
      hour
  source set <source> calls_per_hour=<n>|updates_per_hour=<n>
      one caller makes that many calls of the source in an hour, or that
      many updates among them; a lower number too, which is the operator's
  source grant <source> read|<call>|--preset <preset> --group <group>|--crew <crew member> [--as <user>]
      a group's sessions or a crew member may make the source's read
      calls, or one call by its name; both flags repeat, and it is one
      command and one change; with --preset <name> the preset's calls
      of the pack that declares the source, named on the card with the
      pack; with --as <user> the call is made as that user, and that
      user alone approves it
  source add <file>
      a new source the file declares: the ask carries the declaration
      and each command file it names, the card shows the whole
      declaration, and a commands-free add runs at approval while one
      naming commands is carried out by the server after it; a
      replacement and an absolute program stay in a terminal
  pack apply <name>
      a pack yardr embeds, with no flag: of kind source, or of a depot
      kind re-applied to the one depot that holds it where its plan
      asks nothing; the card is written from the server's own binary
      and shows each declared source whole, and for a depot pack each
      object and each changed file's diff; the approval is carried out
      by the server after it; a directory, URL or imported pack, any
      flag, a first install and a plan that asks stay in a terminal
  hook add <name> --source <declared source> [--unknown unknown|allow|ignore]
      a new webhook endpoint POST /hooks/<name> for the declared
      source, verified with its signing secret given on the hook's own
      secret card (--secret-hook) into the file the yard owns for it;
      for a source that hears by identity, --unknown names what an
      unmapped sender is (unknown without it); --map, --as and a
      replacement stay in a terminal
  subscribe <user> yardr [--done] [--where <key>=<value>]
      a user is told of the yard's own events in their inbox; with --done,
      --where or both
  user set <user> tell=<parts>
      which parts a source tells a user of outside the yard, on their
      phone: a list of notifications, mail and asks with commas between,
      or nothing after tell= for all three again
  user key <user> <source>
      the person's own address in the source, as yardr user key gives
      it: a card of this row is offered by the yard itself, when a
      delivery reaches it from an address no user has, and carries
      that address shown on the card; approving writes it into the
      user's env file (0600) exactly where yardr user key writes it.
      A --run naming it in a terminal carries no address and is
      refused: the value there is typed unseen, as yardr user key
      types it
  user add <name>
      a person becomes a user of the yard, and reads mail from now on
  user rm <name>
      a user goes, with their subscriptions and devices; the mail stays
  crew set <name> open_threads=<sources> | set_state=<sources> | peers=<peers>
      a crew member may open threads or set the status of threads in the
      sources, or mail crew members of the peers
  crew identity <name> --source <source> [--id <id>] [--key <key>]
      who the crew member is in the source: mentions and assignments of
      the id or key there are then addressed to it
  settings set <key> <value>
      the yard's own setting changes; who the operator is and the settings
      of where the yard reads and serves from are the operator's alone,
      while hook_public_url binds nothing and is a run ask's
  peer rename <old> <new>
      the link is called by its new name; its key and what it carries stay
  bead update <bead> --originator <user>
      the bead is for the user
  timer rm <id>
      another's timer is removed; one's own needs no approval

Whether each is the operator's is the command's own check: when the asker
may run the command themselves the ask is refused with that. What is the
operator's alone is refused as a run ask: what defines what the yard runs
or whom it trusts (a command of a group or a source, who a peer sees and
is trusted and reached as, a device, another yard paired), what takes a
file path, and what reaches another yard. Such a command is typed in a
terminal. The subscription and the tell are a user's own as they are the
operator's, since a crew member does not decide what a person is told:
the ask is for that user or for the operator (--to), and the one asked
approves it. The yard splits the command at spaces and nowhere else, so
nothing is quoted: a quote, a backslash, ;, |, &, $ or a line break is
refused, and a comma anywhere but in a list the command takes (the parts
of tell=, the kinds peer allow carries, the grants crew set gives). It checks the
command against the yard as it stands, and refuses one the yard would
refuse and one that would change nothing (a peer, source, group, crew
member, user, setting, timer or bead the yard has not, a number out of
range, what stands already, a grant or a subscription that is held
already, the parts a user is told of already; what the asker may run
needs no approval). The ask is stored with the command in the yard's own form and with the yard's
sentences for what it changes, made from the yard's records, whatever the
question says. The card shows the command whole and those sentences, and
each --context line with the asker's name before it. Nothing runs until
the operator approves (yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --approve), and then
the yard runs exactly the command shown, as the operator; an approval is
refused when the yard changed since the ask, which is then asked again:
what the command changes is not what the card says it is, or what it
names was replaced or set under its name since: the source, the link,
the group, the crew member, the user, the setting, the bead or the
timer.

A run ask takes no --option, --recommend or --about, and at most five
--context lines: why the asker wants it. It is refused, and nothing is
stored, for --to anyone but the operator (for a user's subscription or
tell, that user or the operator) and for --to <person>@<peer>; no copy goes to a
linked yard. A crew member or a user writes one. An agent
working a bead does not: it says what it needs in a note on the bead.

--setup <pack> sets up an embedded pack of kind source as one decision:
the apply, the account and the grants. It takes --crew <name> and --group
<group>, repeatable, at least one: who the grants are for. --recommend
counts the card's preset options as yardr pack show prints them, with
--why saying why, as on any option ask. The card shows the pack's
declaration whole with its mint, the account to type unseen or the listed
candidates to take, and one option per preset, each rendered by the yard
from the declarations with the grantee, and You decide last, which grants
the recommended preset. The operator approves with the preset pick and
the account together (yardr bead answer <id> <ask> <n> --secret, or
--account <source> where the card lists one); the yard then applies the
pack, takes the account, and grants the preset picked, as the operator.
An approval is refused when the yard changed since the ask, which is then
asked again. A pack past 40 lines, one carrying sources under different
credentials, and one with no presets stay on the existing per-step flow:
a pack apply card, an account card per source, and a grant card per
source and kind. --as is refused: a grant as a user is that user's alone
to give, and this card is the operator's.

A setup ask takes no --option, --about or --as, and at most five
--context lines. It is refused, and nothing is stored, for --to anyone
but the operator and for --to <person>@<peer>; no copy goes to a linked
yard. A crew member or a user writes one. An agent working a bead does
not: it says what it needs in a note on the bead.

--new asks a question that is about no bead: it takes the question alone,
makes a bead titled with it and the ask on that bead in one write, and
prints both. An ask that would be refused makes no bead. -b gives the bead
a body and --label its labels (a topic: label is where the question shows
among the person's decisions). The bead is of the type question: it exists
to carry the question, so nothing routes it, no agent is started on it and
no group is told of it, in whatever stage it stands. Whoever asked closes
it when the answer is on it, with what they did with the answer as the
reason (yardr bead close). Without --depot it is of no depot and under no
flow, in the stage new; with --depot it stands where that depot's beads
start. --stage places the bead instead, as bead create does and as a task:
it is routed from that stage like any bead (a depot's decide stage, where
the group of people that stage is routed to holds it), and a stage the
depot's flow does not have is refused.

--take-back takes an open ask back: yardr bead ask --take-back <id> <ask>
"<reason>", for a question that is asked no more (it was settled another
way, or asked again in other words). It is the asker's to do, and the
operator's; anyone else is refused, since nobody ends a question in the
person's place. The ask leaves the person's open decisions wherever it
stands and shows among the decided ones as "taken back by <who>: <reason>",
never as an answer of theirs; the bead's notes say the same. It takes no
answer afterwards: a pick that arrives late is refused with who took it
back and why. An ask that is answered, declined or taken back already is
refused; one put aside is taken back as an open one is. Where the ask was
also sent to a linked yard (--to <person>@<peer>, or by reach) that yard is
told in the same write, and it leaves the decisions there with "it was
taken back in <yard>'s yard". It is a flag of ask, not of answer: answer is
what the person asked does, and this is the asker's own.`,

	answer := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "answer <id> <ask> [<n> [words]]",
		Short: "Answer an ask: pick an option, answer with words, give a secret, approve a command, put it aside, or decline it",
		Long: `Answers an ask on a bead: picks option <n> with any words, answers with
words alone, puts the ask aside, or declines it. The answer is a note of
kind answer naming who picked which option; a newer pick supersedes the
older one for display, and every pick stays as a note. Nothing is deleted.

  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> <n> [words]      pick option n with words alongside
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --words "<text>"   answer an ask with no options
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --later             put it aside for 24 hours
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --decline "<words>"   refuse to decide it
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --secret            give the secret a secret ask asks for
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> <n> --secret        pick a setup ask's preset with the account typed
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> <n> --account <source>   pick a setup ask's preset, taking a listed account
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> <n>                 pick a drift card's preset, keeping the standing account
  yardr bead answer <id> <ask> --approve           approve the command a run ask proposes

<ask> is the ask note's seq, as prime, review and chat print it. <n> counts
the ask's options as shown, "You decide" last.

Words alone on an ask with options are refused. They go as a plain note
(yardr bead note) and leave the ask open. Talk about the question stays
where talk lives, in the conversation with the asker.

--later leaves the person's queue for 24 hours or until the asker's next
note on the bead, whichever is first; answering early is a pick like any
other. --decline ends the ask with no option picked. Wherever the ask is
shown it reads "<user> declined to decide this: <words>". A declined ask
and an ask answered with words take no further answer; a picked ask takes
only a newer pick.

--secret answers a secret ask (yardr bead ask --secret), as yardr source
key gives a credential: on a terminal each name the ask asks for is asked
for in turn and nothing is shown as it is typed; when standard input is no
terminal it is read as NAME=value lines, one for each name. The value is
never an argument and never a variable of the command's environment. The
yard's server writes it into the file the source's credential is read
from, and the answer on the bead says who gave which names: the value is
in that file and nowhere else. It is the operator's to give, and is
refused from the pane of an agent. An ask for a user's own address in a
source (yardr bead ask --secret <source> --for-user <user>) is that user's
to give, or the operator's, into the user's env_file, and names the
command that tells the user through the source when that is still to be
run. An ask for a crew member's own credential in a source (yardr bead ask
--secret <source> --for-crew <name>) is the operator's to give, into the
crew member's env_file, and takes effect when the crew member next starts.
An ask for a user's own credential in a source (yardr bead ask --secret
<source> --as <user>) is that user's to give, or the operator's, into the
user's env_file, and names the check that tries it as them.
An ask for a waiting login's input (yardr bead ask --secret-login
<login>) is handed to the login and kept nowhere. Giving again replaces
what was given.
When the yard wrote the file and could not record it, it says so with the
names and the file: give it again. A secret ask takes no pick and no
words, which are refused and kept nowhere; --later puts it aside as any
ask, and it is declined with --decline "", without words.

<n> --secret answers a setup ask (yardr bead ask --setup): the preset
pick with the account typed unseen beside it, as --secret types it.
<n> --account <source> answers it taking the named candidate's account
instead, one the card lists with its address; where the card lists any,
exactly one of the two settles the account, and where it lists none the
typed value does. A drift card, on a pack already applied, is kept with a
bare <n> where its file holds every name, typed missing names where the
update newly needs them, or a candidate's file taken as ever. The yard
then applies the pack, takes the account, and grants the preset picked,
as the operator, and records what ran. It is the operator's to give, and
is refused from the pane of an agent. A pick with --secret or --account
is allowed on a setup ask only, as a bare pick that keeps is; everywhere
else a secret answer still takes no pick.

--approve answers a run ask (yardr bead ask --run): the yard runs the
command the ask holds, exactly as its card shows it, as the operator, and
records on the bead what ran and what it printed. It is the operator's to
give and nobody else's, and is refused from the pane of an agent whatever
--actor says. A user's own subscription, and which parts they are told
of, is approved by the one it was asked of, that user or the operator, and runs as them. A command runs once for one ask: an ask that was approved,
declined or taken back takes no approval. It is refused too, and nothing
runs, when the yard is no longer what the card was written from: what the
command changes was changed in between, or what it names was replaced
under its name. The ask is then declined and asked again. What the command
itself would refuse at a terminal is refused in the same words. A run ask
takes no pick and no words, which are refused; --later puts it aside and
--decline "<words>" ends it, as for any ask. The card names the command
that takes the change back and who may run it: anyone, but for a source's
limits (the operator) and a user's subscription (the user or the
operator).

An ask another yard asked is answered as <bead>@<peer>, the ref the
decisions queue shows: the answer is queued home for that yard instead
of written as a note, and the question stands decided here from then
on. Only the person the question is for answers it, the link must carry
asks out (yardr peer allow <peer> --send ask), and --later there is 24
hours by this yard's clock and nothing else. Words alone on an ask with
options go as mail to the asker instead (yardr mail <asker>@<peer>).`,
