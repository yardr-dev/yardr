		Use:   "source <depot> (role <group|crew> | flow [--type <type>]) (depot | pack)",
		Short: "Switch one role or flow of a depot between the depot's own and the pack's",
		Long: `Switch one line of yardr depot sources between the depot's repository and the
pack imported into the depot, and print the line as it is afterwards.

  role  sets the prompt of the group or crew member: to roles/<name>.md, which
        yardr resolves to the depot's .yardr/roles/<name>.md on the base
        branch, or to the pack's installed copy under the yard's home. A
        crew member is the yard's and reads a path as it is, so its depot's role
        is the file in the depot's checkout, by its absolute path.
  flow  clears the depot's flow pointer (depot), or points it at the pack's flow
        in the store (pack); with --type, the pointer of that type's beads.
        A flow switches whole: its stage files come with it, the depot's
        beside its flow file, the pack's from the yard's home.

Refused, changing nothing, when the chosen source does not exist: the depot
has no such file on its base, no pack is imported into the depot or none has
the role or a flow. A flow change is refused as yardr depot flow is, naming
the beads, while an open bead sits in a stage the new flow lacks.

A pack's record still says whose roles its import chose, so the next yardr
pack apply sets them again; the output says when that undoes the switch.`,

  yardr depot source web role yardmaster pack
  yardr depot source web flow depot
  yardr depot source web flow --type decision pack`,
