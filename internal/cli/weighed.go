// The gate in front of a weighty approval (design yardr-ekmx 3.3). The yard
// refuses a weighty card approved by a call that does not say its person saw
// the weight (weighed), and checks nothing more: the word is the client's.
// A terminal keeps it by asking: it prints the card's weight and wants the
// ask's number typed back, and sends weighed on a match and stops on
// anything else. It is friction against approving on reflex and no
// authentication, since the terminal is the yard's own machine and its shell
// is the operator's.
//
// Without a terminal the card is declined, not approved on a flag: a gate
// that a script walks through is not a gate. The person approves it in
// footplate or in a terminal.

// askedCard reads the ask seq of the bead id as the yard stored it. It says
// no when the ask cannot be read here (a bead@peer, which no command of this
// yard approves, an ask that is not there): the call that follows refuses
// that in its own words, and the gate stays out of its way.
