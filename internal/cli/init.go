func (a *app) initCmd() *cobra.Command {

	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "init [--harness <kind>]",
		Short: "Create the yard: default harness and the yardmaster, with its role from the default pack (what the onboarding does)",
		Long: `Create the yard in --home (else YARDR_HOME, default ~/.yardr) without the onboarding form,
for scripts and tests. It stores --harness as the yard's default_kind, and
adds the yardmaster crew member on that harness with its unattended flags,
rotating every 6h. The daemon starts the yardmaster.

The yardmaster's role is a pack's: the one the yard's default pack (the
default_pack setting, else starter, which yardr carries) gives its crew
member called yardmaster. Init installs that one file under
<home>/packs/<pack>/roles/, naming --operator as the person the yardmaster
brings decisions to, and makes it the yardmaster's prompt. A depot's builders
and reviewers get their roles beside it when the depot is set up (yardr
depot init). A default pack with no crew member called yardmaster gets the
yard none. Init again on a yard that has its yardmaster reads no pack and
writes no role: a role installed from a pack is changed in the pack and
brought to the yard by yardr pack apply, which shows the change first.

<home>/roles/, which init wrote before a yard had a default pack, is no
longer written. A yard that has it keeps it: a group whose prompt is
roles/<name>.md reads it as before (docs/configuration.md, "Role prompts"),
and init leaves every file there as it is.

Init does not start the daemon unless told to: --start starts one in the
background (none is started when one runs on the home already), logging to
<home>/daemon.log, and waits up to --wait for the yardmaster: its session
running and its first output in its pane, after its first prompt. It then
prints where the yardmaster is in herdr (agent, workspace, tab, pane) and how
to get there, or, when the yardmaster did not come up, what is known (the last
lines of its pane among it) and how to go on, and exits 1. It is what the
onboarding form does on "Start the yard now?".

In a terminal, --start first asks whether to check that the yardmaster's
harness answers, as the onboarding does: one real call to it outside a pane,
the one yardr doctor --try makes, which costs a model call. A harness that
does not answer is named with what it printed, and the call is made again, the
start goes on all the same, or it stops there and starts nothing. Without a
terminal, with --json and in an agent's session it asks nothing and makes no
call before the start. After a start that failed on the harness, it makes that
call once by itself instead, with a terminal or without, and says with the
failure what it came to: the harness's answer and, where it tells, what to do.

In a terminal, --start then opens yardr chat on the yardmaster, as the
onboarding does: the yardmaster's first session is asked to greet the operator
by mail (yardr mail <operator>), and the chat is where that mail shows and
where the setup goes on as a conversation. Leaving it stops nothing. Without a
terminal, with --json, in an agent's session and with --no-chat it opens
nothing, and what it prints names yardr chat. Run it again on a running yard
to be told where the yardmaster is. yardr daemon in a terminal pane of its own
does the same in the foreground, to watch it.

Run yardr in a terminal on a home with no yard to get the same as a form. A
home counts as set up once init has stored default_kind, or once its store has
depots, groups, crew members or beads (a yard from before the onboarding); the
store file alone does not, since the server creates it on any first command.
Init again on a yard keeps its default_kind, operator and yardmaster settings
and an existing yardmaster crew member; only the flags given change them, so
--harness is required only to create a yard.

--style says how agents should work with you, and --about what they should
know about you (one line). They are stored as the settings operator_style
and operator_note, which every session reads when it starts: yardr prime
prints them as instructions, so yardr settings set changes what the next
session reads, with no init. Without --style a new yard has no style, and
the primes say nothing about it; init again keeps both. The styles:

` + styleHelp() + `

A run that failed leaves what it made before the failure (the order is: the
yardmaster's role, the operator and yardmaster settings, the yardmaster, default_kind), and init
again finishes from it. The settings stored stand in for the flags not given,
and the yardmaster's kind for --harness once the yardmaster is there; the summary then
says "finished", with what it found and what it added (--json: found, added).
On a yard that is set up and did not start, init --start starts and waits
again. Bare yardr in a terminal does the same on a yard with no depot yet,
after saying what is there and asking, and then goes on as the onboarding
does. docs/configuration.md has both, and how to remove a yard and start
over.

After init the yardmaster sets up the rest in conversation, or yardr setup does in
a terminal, as forms. For scripts, the same by hand:

  yardr depot add webapp ~/projects/webapp --base main
  yardr depot init webapp --yes --bind builders=claude --bind reviewers=claude \
    --members backlog= --members decisions=jo

depot init sets the depot up from the yard's default pack: its groups, their
roles, the flow and the routes go into the yard, and nothing into the
repository. It sets the depot's test command when the repository says how
it is tested (yardr depot init --help).

` + agents.UnattendedHelp(),
		Example: `  yardr init --harness claude

func (a *app) settingsCmd() *cobra.Command {

		Long: `The yard's own defaults. yardr settings get lists them with what each means.
Anyone reads them; only the operator changes one (yardr settings set), so
an agent is refused. A yard that names no operator yet takes a setting from
anyone who is no agent of its own.

hook_addr is the address the server takes webhooks on (yardr hook --help).
The server reads it when it starts, so a change takes its next start (yardr
server stop; the next command starts it again), and YARDR_HOOK_ADDR in the
environment the server starts in is used instead of it. yardr doctor says
which address is in use.

web_addr and bdp_addr are the addresses the web view and the BDP server
listen on when yardr web or yardr bdp serve, start or install is given no
--addr and the command's YARDR_WEB_ADDR or YARDR_BDP_ADDR is unset:
127.0.0.1:8791 and 127.0.0.1:8765 unless set, so a second yard on one
machine sets its own. The flag wins over the environment, which wins over
the setting. web_addr takes a loopback address, as --addr does without
--unsafe. One that runs keeps its address until it is stopped and started
again, and a login service the one in its file until it is installed again;
settings set says so.

web_as is the user the web view acts as when yardr web serve, start or
install is given no --as and the command's YARDR_WEB_AS is unset: its talk
page and its beads' asks then act as that user, as with the flag
(docs/web.md, "Acting as a user"). The flag wins over the environment,
which wins over the setting, and with none of them the view reads only.
The view refuses to start when no user of the yard has the name. One that
runs keeps its user until it is stopped and started again, and a login
service's view reads the setting at every start.

herdr_session is the herdr session the yard's agents run in (herdr session
list). Set, every call the yard makes to herdr goes to it, from the daemon,
a command or a login service, whatever shell each was started from. Unset,
each uses the session of its own environment (HERDR_SOCKET_PATH, else
HERDR_SESSION, else herdr's default), so a daemon and a command started in
two herdr sessions do not see the same panes. It is changed while no crew
member and no session of a bead runs: their panes stay in the old session.
yardr starts no herdr session; yardr status and yardr doctor say which one
is in use.

operator_style is how agents should work with the operator, and
operator_note one line they should know about them. Every session reads both
when it starts (yardr prime --bead and --crew print them as
instructions), so a change reaches the next session; unset, the primes say
nothing. The styles:

` + styleHelp() + `

default_pack is the pack yardr depot init sets a depot up from when it is
given no --pack: a name (of a pack the yard has imported, or of one yardr
carries), a pack's directory as an absolute path, or a pack's URL. Unset, a git depot gets
starter and a directory depot dir, the two packs yardr carries. yardr init
takes the yardmaster's role from it. Changing it moves nothing: it is read
when a depot is set up (docs/packs.md).

timer_limit and timer_min_every bound the yard's timers (yardr timer): how
many live ones one crew member or user may have set, and the shortest period of
a recurring one. They hold for timers set from then on.

blob_max_bytes is the most bytes one image in mail may have (yardr mail
--file), 8388608 (8 MiB) unless set.

max_sessions is the most sessions that run on this machine at once, over
all groups: what the machine carries, beside each group's limit. A session
that starts an agent or a script counts (a herdr or an exec group's); a
manual group's claim, a peer group's wait and the crew do not. A bead that
waits for it gets one capped event. The daemon reads it on every pass, so a
change holds at once; unset or 0, nothing is capped. yardr status shows it
with how many run.

backup_every has the daemon keep dated copies of the store: a duration such
as 1d, and unset or 0, never. It makes one when the newest is older than
that, as yardr store backup does, in backup_dir (an absolute path; unset,
backups in the yard's home), named yard-<date and time>.db, and removes its
own older ones beyond backup_keep (7 unless set); a file there it did not
name is left alone. A copy that fails is one backup_failed event, and yardr
status says when the last was made. Restore one by stopping the yard (yardr
down) and copying it over yard.db (docs/configuration.md).`}
