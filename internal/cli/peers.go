		Long: `Two yards are linked when the operator of each has added the other, by its
public key. They share no store: each sends the other signed messages, and
takes only the kinds its operator allowed, each direction on its own. A new
link carries nothing.

The short way, when one operator can read a code to the other:

  yardr peer pair                      in a terminal: a form, on both yards. Else,
                                       on the yard that can be reached: shows a code
  yardr peer pair <address> <code>     on the other: the yards exchange their keys,
                                       each operator confirms a check, a ping proves it

The way by hand, when no code can be passed, or for scripts:

  yardr peer key                       this yard's public key (made on first use)
  yardr peer invite --url <url>        one line for the other operator to paste
  yardr peer add <name> <invite>       add the other yard, from its invite
  yardr peer allow <name> --send ping --receive ping
  yardr peer ping <name>               prove the link, both ways
  yardr peer rename <old> <new>        change the name this yard has for a link
  yardr peer set <name> --url <url>    change where this yard calls it; --url "" for
                                       a yard that is never called, and calls
  yardr peer intake <name> --depot <depot> --flow <flow>
                                       where the beads it sends go (with
                                       yardr peer allow <name> --receive bead)

The other yard's requests come in on the server's hook listener, under
/peers/, beside /hooks/ (yardr settings set hook_addr <host:port>): a yard
without a listener takes nothing in. A yard that cannot be reached at all (a
laptop behind a router) gives no --url in its invite: it is never called, it
calls the other and asks for what waits there. One of two linked yards must be
reachable. The daemon carries the messages (yardr daemon).

Every request and every answer is signed with the sender's key. That proves
who sent it and that it is whole. It does not hide it: over plain http the body
is readable by whoever carries it, so put TLS in front of the listener for
anything that is not on one machine or a private network. See docs/peers.md.`}

--send for what this yard may send the peer, --receive for what it takes from
it. Nothing is allowed until this says so, and only the operator may allow.
--no-send and --no-receive stop a kind again, which anyone may.

Each yard tells the other which kinds its yardr understands (yardr peer show).
--send for a kind the peer has said it does not understand, or for a peer
that has not said, is allowed and warns: what a peer said may be stale, and a
message its yardr does not know is refused there and given up here with that
reason.

A message of a kind not allowed is refused before it leaves, and one that
comes in is answered 403 and logged (peer_message_refused). The kinds:
  ping   yardr peer ping: a ping, and the pong that answers it. A ping needs
         the kind allowed both ways on both sides, since the answer is a
         message too.
  mail   yardr mail <crew member>@<peer>: mail between crew members of the two
         yards. --send lets this yard's crew write (each needs the peer
         in its peers setting too), --receive puts the peer's mail in the
         inbox of the crew member it names.
  file   yardr mail <crew member>@<peer> --file: the images mail carries, each
         a message of its own that crosses before its mail. --send lets
         this yard's mail to the peer carry images, --receive lets the
         peer's bytes land in this yard's blobs. Without --receive the
         peer's mail still arrives, and says "not taken" where the image
         would be. One file may have up to yardr settings get
         ` + store.PeerFileMaxSetting + ` bytes, on each side by its own setting.
  bead   a bead of one yard worked by the other. --receive lets this yard
         take the peer's beads, each as a bead of its own, and send back how
         it ended; where they go is yardr peer intake, and without one each
         is refused. --send lets this yard send the peer beads and take
         what comes back. One word covers the bead and its answer, so a yard
         that only receives can be sent work and can send none.
  ask    yardr bead ask <id> "<question>" --to <person>@<peer>: a question
         asked of a person of the other yard. It stands among their
         decisions there, and their pick comes back onto the bead. --send
         lets this yard's crew and users ask (each crew member needs the
         peer in its peers setting too), --receive lets the peer's asks
         stand among this yard's decisions. The answer is a message too,
         so each yard allows the kind both ways.
  thread what a yard says of a bead it works for the other while the bead
         is there. --send lets this yard tell the peer how the beads it
         took from it stand: that one arrived, entered a stage, was held,
         had its hold lifted or was given up, with the stage and no text.
         --receive lets this yard keep what the peer says of this yard's
         beads there, which yardr bead show prints under where the bead
         is. Without the word on either side beads cross as they do
         without it, and nothing is said until the return.

Whom of this yard the peer may see and write to is said apart, by name:
--expose <name>,... for crew members and users of this yard, which only the
operator may, and --no-expose to stop, which anyone may. Nobody is exposed
until this says so. The peer is told the names, each with one line of what
they do (yardr peer show there lists them), and mail from it reaches those
names and no other: mail to anyone else is refused (not_exposed). --receive
mail is still what lets the link carry mail at all; --expose alone shows the
peer who is there.

--trust <name>@<peer>=<user> says that mail from that name of the peer's
yard counts as that user of this yard speaking: it arrives marked "(as
<user>)", and a crew member takes it as the user's word. An answer the name
gives to a question this yard asked it is marked the same way, wherever the
ask is read. <name> must be on the roster the peer last said (yardr peer
show lists whom it exposes) and <user> a user of this yard (yardr user
list). Only the operator may; --no-trust <name>@<peer> stops it, which
anyone may. It is about mail and answers and nothing else: the name gets no
powers of the operator's and runs no command.
The grant goes when the user is removed or the peer exposes the name no
more (docs/peers.md).

--reach <name>@<peer>=<user> is a second grant, beside trust and only for a
name already trusted as that user: every ask for the user in this yard is
also sent to that name, where it stands among their decisions, and the
answer the name gives there is taken as the user's. What is sent is the
ask whole, with its bead's handle, title, topic, stage, labels and body
(cut at 16 KB) and the handle, title and stage of each bead it is about:
whoever runs the other yard can read it, and can answer as the user. So
give it for a name of a yard whose operator you would trust with every
question put to the user here and with the answer to each. <name> must be a
person on the roster the peer last said, and the link must carry ask out
for anything to be sent. Asks that are open already are not sent; the
command says how many stay in this yard alone. Only the operator may;
--no-reach <name>@<peer> stops it, which anyone may, and an answer that
arrives afterwards is refused. Trust without reach sends nothing. The grant
goes with the trust it stands on.`,

		Long: `A linked yard can send this one a bead to work (yardr peer allow <name>
--receive bead). The intake says where such a bead goes: it becomes a bead of
this yard in --depot, pinned to --flow, in that flow's first stage, labelled
from-<name>. When the flow ends it (a terminal stage), the outcome and the
notes written here go back. Without an intake every bead the peer sends is
refused (no_intake).

The flow is this yard's choice, never the sender's: a flow of the store
(yardr flow add) or of the depot's repository.

The flow's first stage says who looks at such a bead first, and nothing else
does: the bead arrives there unheld and is routed as any bead in that stage.
Its text is another yard's, and it becomes the brief of an agent that runs
with this yard's permissions, so choose the stage for that:
  - routed to a manual group with members, a member reads each bead and
    moves it on (yardr bead done) or closes it, which returns it as refused;
    a move by anyone else is refused, from a crew member's pane whatever
    name the command gives:
      yardr group add arrivals --runner manual --members <you> --set wait=1d
      yardr route add --stage <first stage> --group arrivals --label from-<name>
  - routed to a manual group without members, anyone of this yard may move
    it on, a crew member too;
  - routed to agents, a script or another yard, work starts on it unseen.
    That lets the operator of the other yard start agents here;
  - routed to nobody, it waits until a route leads somewhere.
This command answers with which of these holds, and yardr peer show and
yardr doctor say it again, read from the routes as they are then.

--limit is how many open beads from the peer this yard keeps at once (10
unless set): the next is refused (busy) until one ends.

Nothing sends a bead back by a clock. A manual group's wait setting tells
its subscribers of a bead that waits there (yardr group set <group>
wait=1d); the bead ends when someone moves or closes it.

Only the operator may set an intake, as only the operator allows what a link
carries. --none removes it, which anyone may. Refused when the depot is none
of the yard's or the flow does not resolve for it.`,
