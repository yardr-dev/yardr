             runs, whether it is open to the network (--unsafe, no login
             outside JWT mode) or to this machine only, and whom it acts as
             (--as, YARDR_WEB_AS or web_as) or whose tokens it verifies in
             JWT mode (jwt from); the build of this yardr when that is
             another; its login service
  hooks      the address the server takes webhooks on, each hook and its URL
  peers      each linked yard and where it is called
  work       how many sessions run in each group, how many beads wait for
             a person in each manual group, and how many beads are held;
             with max_sessions set (yardr settings), how many of the
             sessions count against it, or that the yard is paused at 0
  backups    how often the daemon copies the store, how many dated copies it
             keeps and where (the settings backup_every, backup_keep and
             backup_dir), and when the last was made; or that none is kept

A part the yard does not have (hooks, peers) has no line. It is read-only
and starts nothing: on a yard whose server is not running it says so, with
the daemon and the web views, which it reads from the home, and one line
for the crew, hooks, peers and work, which only the server knows. It reads
the backup settings from the store file without starting the server.

A web view does not replace itself when a new yardr is installed, as the
server and the daemon do: it runs the build it was started on until it is
started again, which is why its build is listed.

yardr status says what is there; yardr doctor says what is wrong or missing.
When doctor reports a fault, the last line of status says so and names it,
without repeating it. The exit status is 0 whenever the home holds a yard,
and 2 on a home with none.

A web view is found by the record it keeps in <home>/webviews while it
runs. One started by a build of yardr before this command existed keeps
none and is not listed until it is started again.`,
		Example: `  yardr status
  yardr status --json | jq -r '.web.views[].url'   # where the web view is`,
