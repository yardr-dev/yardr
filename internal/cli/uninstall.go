		Use:   "uninstall",
		Short: "Stop the yard, remove its login services, and say what is left and where",
		Long: `Take this yard off the machine, in this order:

  stop it         as yardr down does, with its warning, its question and its
                  --yes: the daemon, every agent this yard started, the web
                  view, the BDP server, the telemetry export, the server
  login services  every one yardr wrote for this yard: the daemon's, the web
                  view's, the BDP server's and the telemetry export's, as
                  yardr <kind> uninstall removes each. yardr's service for
                  herdr's server goes only when no other yard of yours starts
                  at login (it is left, and that yard named); one that is
                  not yardr's is never touched. herdr's server runs on.
  what is left    one list of what was not touched, and where each is

Nothing of your work is deleted. What uninstall leaves, and lists:

  the yard's home   the store with every bead, the roles, flows and logs
  each depot        your repository, the .yardr directory in it, the
                    worktrees of the yard's beads (said where one has
                    uncommitted changes) and the branches under yard/
  yardr             this program: it does not delete itself
  herdr, harnesses  where each is, and that it is removed as it was installed

Each has its path, and the command that removes it where one does. yardr
uninstall is safe to repeat: a yard that does not run and has no login
service is no error, and the list is printed all the same. After it the
yard is as yardr down --login leaves it, and yardr up starts it again.
Nothing is removed while nothing was stopped (a question not agreed to, a
daemon that could not be stopped).

--purge deletes the yard's home too, and nothing else of yours. It names the
directory, says how many beads are in its store, and asks you to type the
yard's name (yardr status prints it) before anything is stopped. With nobody
to ask (stdin closed, a script, --json) it needs both --yes and the name as
the flag's value, --purge=<name>: --yes alone deletes no yard, and a wrong
name stops nothing. Only the yard's operator may: anyone else, an agent of
the yard too, is refused before anything is stopped. It never deletes a depot's repository, though one cloned
into the home (yardr depot add --clone) is inside it; nor a worktree with
uncommitted changes, or one git cannot read; nor a branch; nor this program.
What it kept is listed, and the home stays for it. A worktree without
changes is removed as git worktree remove does: its commits are on its
branch, in the depot.

--json prints the same as data: down (yardr down's answer), login (each
service with part, result: removed, absent or left, file and error), purge
(home, beads, deleted, gone, kept) and left: each thing with kind (home,
depot, yardr_dir, worktree, branches, login_service, yardr, herdr, harness),
name, path, detail and remove. Without --yes, on a yard with any agent, it
stops nothing and answers "confirm": true with the agents in down, as yardr
down --json does. The exit status is 0 when uninstalled is true or confirm
is, else 1.`,
		Example: `  yardr uninstall
  yardr uninstall --yes                    # a script: no question about agents at work
  yardr uninstall --json | jq '.left'      # what is left, as data
