func (a *app) sourceCmd() *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "source",
		Short: "Services outside the yard, each declared by one file",
		Long: `A declared source is a service outside the yard that was added by a file:
its address, the credential it takes and the requests the yard may make of
it, each with its parameters. No Go is written for one. What a file cannot
say (a request that must be signed, an answer in pages, anything but JSON
or a file upload over HTTPS) is not a declared source.

  name: crm
  about: The customer system.
  base: https://crm.example.com/api/v2
  credential:
    env: CRM_TOKEN                                # the name, never the value
    header: "Authorization: Bearer {credential}"
  check: ping                                     # a read call without parameters
  calls:
    ping: { kind: read, request: { method: GET, path: /me } }
    note:
      kind: update
      about: Add a note to a customer
      params:
        id:   { type: string, pattern: "^[0-9]{1,12}$" }
        text: { type: string, max: 2000 }
      request: { method: POST, path: "/customers/{id}/notes", body: { text: "{text}" } }
      answer: { select: [id, created] }

A call is read or update. Its parameters are string (with pattern and max),
int, bool, enum (with values) or file (with max, in bytes), all required
unless optional: true. A {param} in the path, the query or the body is
replaced by the value, escaped by where it stands; a file stands alone as
a value of the body. The body is sent as JSON, or as a multipart upload
when it names a file parameter, and a value that is exactly {param} is
sent as the parameter's type; one whose optional parameter was not given
is left out. The answer is JSON: select keeps the named top-level keys of a success and
errors the named dot paths of a refusal, at most 64 KB (answer.max raises that, to 1 MiB at most).

The file holds no secret. {credential} stands for the value of the variable
credential.env names, read at each call from the file the operator gives it
in (yardr source key <name>, which asks for the value and has the server
write the file) or names (yardr source set <name> env_file=<file>). It goes in the credential's header,
or as a whole value of a body for a service that takes it there, and never
in a path or a query. A service that takes it in the path says so with
in_path: true, and then {credential} may stand in a path, where it goes as
it is; a credential there is in the logs of every server on the way, and a
query refuses one either way. credential.update_env names a second variable
of that file, which the update calls are sent with instead, so that the read
calls run on a credential that may only read.

A credential that expires is minted at each call instead of kept: the file
names under credential.mint the variables that together select it, names
only, and the command that turns their values into a token is set on the
source (yardr source set <name> mint_command=<program> [args...]), run with
{inputs, scope} on stdin for a {token, expires_at}. The file may bring that
command itself, credential.mint_command, a program beside the file that the
yard copies and hashes as it does every command's: it mints where the
source's mint_command is unset, and one the operator sets wins over it. The
token is handed to the call under credential.env, and kept in memory alone.
An env that sets the mint's names is minted from; one of them alone is
refused; otherwise the variable is used as it is set.

  credential:
    env: CRM_TOKEN
    mint: [CRM_APP_ID, CRM_APP_KEY]
    mint_command: [crm-mint]          # optional: a file beside this one
    header: "Authorization: Bearer {credential}"

  credential:
    env: CRM_READ_TOKEN
    update_env: CRM_WRITE_TOKEN
    header: "Authorization: Bearer {credential}"
  idempotency: Idempotency-Key

A service whose address is its secret, a webhook URL such as Zapier, Make
and n8n give, says so with url: true. The credential is then that address:
the file names no base, and a call has no path of its own. The value is held
to what a base is when a call is made (https, or plain http to this machine;
no user, query or fragment), and no error, event or command repeats any of
it. An answer that is no JSON is the endpoint saying it took the call (Make
says Accepted), and is not kept.

  credential:
    env: WEBHOOK_URL
    url: true

A service that runs in several regions declares each region's base under
bases beside its own, which stays the default: its calls go to the one the
yard set with yardr source set <name> base=<name>, and to its own with none
set. Each is held to what a base is, and no free-text base is accepted: the
credential goes only to a host the file declares.

  base: https://crm.example.com/api/v2
  bases:
    us: https://crm.example.com/api/v2
    eu: https://eu.crm.example.com/api/v2

A service the operator may run on a server of their own declares the address
that server answers at under base_template, with {host} once, straight after
https://, and the path every call is under: yardr source set <name> host=<host>
sends the calls to it, and to the base with none set. The host is a name or an
address with an optional port and nothing else, typed by the operator alone,
and the address it makes is held to what a base is.

  base: https://api.crm.example.com/v2
  base_template: https://{host}/api/v2

idempotency names the header a service takes a key in, by which it tells an
update it was sent before from a new one. yardr call then sends each update
with a key, and the same key when the same caller makes the same call with
the same values again after one that did not end in a success: a call run
again after a timeout writes once. After a success the same call is a new
one. A key nobody tried again is kept for ` + store.SourceKeyKept.String() + `.

Refused when the file is added: a base that is not https:// (plain http://
only to this machine, for a stand-in), or one beside credential.url; a path
that is an address, has '..' or a query; a {param} the call does not
declare; a read call with PUT, PATCH or DELETE; a name yardr has built in
(` + strings.Join(source.BuiltIn, ", ") + `). (machine is built in as well,
as the yard's own limits source, but a file may still take its name: the
declaration wins over the built-in while it stands.) When a call is made,
no redirect is followed, the call ends after ` + source.Timeout.String() + `, and an answer over its
bound is refused, not cut.

A source can tell a person outside the yard when its file has a notify key:
the update call that does it, and which of the call's parameters take what
the yard has to say.

  notify:
    call: message
    address: { param: user, env: PHONE_USER }  # where the person is reached
    title: title                                  # the yard's value: the call's parameter
    text: text
    link: link

address.env is the name of a variable in the env file of the user who is
told, not of the source's: the address is one person's. title, text and link
are each left out for a call that has no place for one; one of title and
text is there. Refused: a call that is not in the file or is a read call; a
parameter the call does not have, or one that is no string; a required
parameter of the call that nothing here fills; a link parameter that is
required. A title or a text longer than its parameter's max is cut to it; a
link that is too long is left out. A user is given the source with
yardr user set <name> notify=<source> env_file=<file>.

A source can say what the subscription of a harness kind still carries (the
windows of its usage limit, how far each is used, when it resets) when its
file has a limits key: a command, and the harness kinds it answers for.
Such a file needs no base and no calls, and with neither has no credential,
check or notify either.

  name: aiquokka
  about: Usage limits of the subscriptions the agents' CLIs are logged in to.
  limits:
    command: [aiquokka, "{provider}", --json]   # a file beside this one, below
    kinds:              # harness kind: the provider's own name for it
      claude: claude
      kimi: kimi

yardr carries aiquokka's source: yardr source add aiquokka adds it with no file.

With no kinds the source answers for itself instead: its command takes no
{provider} and is asked by the source's name, for the windows it reports:

  name: queue
  limits:
    command: [queue/limits]

One such source is built into the yard: machine, the load, swap, disk and
memory of the machine the yard runs on, answered in process with no file
and no credential. Its windows carry no target and never reset: the
thresholds live in the route conditions that name them (machine.load<80),
as docs/integrations.md says. A declared source named machine wins over
it while it stands.

The command is run by yardr itself, as the user yardr runs as: without a
shell (each word is one element of the list), its stdin closed, in the
yard's home, with {provider} replaced by the name the kind maps to, for at
most ` + limits.Timeout.String() + `, after which it and everything it started are killed. Name the
program by its whole path (the daemon's PATH need not be your shell's), or
as a file beside the declaration, which add copies into the yard. It
answers with exit status 0 and one JSON object on stdout, at most 64 KB:

  {"provider": "Kimi", "plan": "…", "windows": [
    {"label": "5h", "used_percent": 100, "target_percent": 60, "resets_at": "2026-10-07T00:02:32Z", "used": 100, "limit": 100}]}

provider and windows are required, and each window's label; used_percent is
a number, target_percent a number from 0 to 100 (the share of the window
that has passed), used and limit whole numbers, resets_at a time as RFC
3339 writes one, model and plan strings, each left out when the provider
does not know it. Other keys are passed over. A window is used up at
used_percent 100 or more, or when used has reached limit; against
target_percent a route's quota condition compares the pace instead of a
number (yardr route add --help). model is the model a window counts for
alone, where the provider caps one model beside what its models share
("Fable"), and is left out of a window they all draw from: a group with no
condition does not wait for a window that has one. Anything else (another
exit status, no answer in time, other output) is no answer: the limits are
then not known, and the reason is the last lines the command printed on
stderr.

Refused when the file is added: a command that is no list of strings, one
with no {provider} among its arguments where the file names kinds, or with
it in the program; a {provider} where the file names no kinds; a kind herdr
starts no agent of; a kind another source of the yard already answers for.
No pack brings a limits key: it is a command the yard runs, so it is the
operator's. What runs the command: yardr limits, yardr source check and
yardr doctor --try, each when a person asks, and the daemon when a harness
stopped on a usage limit, for the window and its reset in the
session_harness_error, once more at that reset before it prompts the agent,
and for a ready bead whose route puts a quota condition on a group or
names a group that starts agents (docs/groups.md). yardr limits --help says
more.

A file can also name the commands by which the yard speaks in the source's
threads, and how the source's issues are a bead's link:

  thread:
    reply:  [linear/thread, reply]      # in {thread, parent, body, key}  out {id, url}
    posted: [linear/thread, posted]     # in {thread, key}                out {id, url} or {}
    read:   [linear/thread, read]       # in {thread}                     out {messages: [...]}
    place:  team                        # what --in is called in this source
    open:   [linear/thread, open]       # in {in, title, body, key}       out {id, title, url}
    opened: [linear/thread, opened]     # in {in, key}                    out {id, title, url} or {}
    state:  [linear/thread, state]      # in {thread, state, forward?}    out {status, moved, was?}
    states: [started, review, done]     # the words thread.state takes
  link:
    host: linear.app
    issue: '^/([^/]+)/issue/([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-[0-9]+)'
    fixed: "https://linear.app/{1}/issue/{2}"   # templates over the
    thread: "{2}"                               # expression's groups

Each command is run as the limits command is: a list without a shell, one
JSON object on stdin, one on stdout, exit 0. posted and opened answer {}
for none: a second attempt asks first, so nothing is posted twice.
thread.state picks the source's status for the word and moves exactly:
only a thread already in the status is reported as not moved. A stage
map's move calls the same command with forward, which never moves a
thread backwards, and reports what a moved thread was in as was.
A program with no / at its start is a file beside the declaration's file:
source add copies it under ~/.yardr/sources/<name>/ (the relative path
kept, mode 0700) and the command runs from there, source show lists it with
its sha256, and source rm removes the directory; an absolute program is the
operator's own and is not copied. A command's environment is PATH, HOME,
USER, LOGNAME, the proxy and CA variables the process that runs it has
(HTTPS_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, NO_PROXY, their lower-case forms, SSL_CERT_FILE,
SSL_CERT_DIR, NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS), the variable credential.env names and
YARDR_SOURCE_BASE, the declaration's base: nothing else of the yard's
environment. The core hands the command
the credential's value: the caller's own. Refused: a command that is no
list of strings or has no program, a thread.open without thread.place, a
thread.state without thread.states, a state that is none of started,
review, done, a link.issue that does not compile, a template naming a group
the expression has not. A pack for a depot brings no thread or link key;
a pack of kind source may, with the commands' files.
What runs the commands: yardr reply, yardr thread show, yardr thread open,
yardr thread state and yardr link, each with the calling process's
credential, and the daemon for a hook's stage map, with the crew member's.

A file can also name the credential helper git runs for the source's host,
for a depot whose origin is there:

  git:
    credential: [github/git-credential]

The yard copies it with the declaration's other command files and never
runs it: the depot's git is pointed at the copy, which answers git's own
protocol from the source's env file at the moment git asks. Refused: a
command that is no list of strings or has no program, and a helper beside
no credential, or beside a credential that is the address every call goes
to. A pack for a depot brings no git key; a pack of kind source may, with
the helper's file.

A file can also say what the service sends in: a hook key makes the source
one a hook receives, as linear and github are, with the secret in the
hook's --secret-file verified as the file says.

  hook:
    verify:
      scheme: hmac-sha256
      signed: body
      signature: { header: Linear-Signature, encoding: hex }
      delivery:  { header: Linear-Delivery }
      timestamp: { body: webhookTimestamp, unit: ms, window: 1m }
    bodies: unique
    normalize: [linear/normalize]
    keys: [team, project, label]

  hook:
    verify:
      scheme: secret
      signature: { header: X-Service-Secret }
    bodies: unique
    normalize: [service/normalize]

verify is data, checked by the core: with scheme hmac-sha256 the
HMAC of what signed names (the word body for the raw body, or a
template over {timestamp}, {body} and {delivery}:
"v0:{timestamp}:{body}") with the hook's secret, made with SHA-256 unless
algorithm says sha1 or sha512 (algorithm: sha1), in hex or base64, past
the prefix (prefix: "sha256=", or none). signature.list is the separator
of the several signatures a service may send in one header (list: " "),
any one of which may match; key says the secret writes the key, not the
key's own bytes (key: { prefix: "whsec_", encoding: base64 }). With
scheme secret the secret itself arrives in the header (signature: {
header: X-Service-Secret }) or in the body at the dot path (signature:
{ body: token }), compared as it arrives. delivery is where the
service's id of the delivery arrives: in
a header, or in the body at the dot path (delivery: { body: update_id });
with scheme secret it is left out for a service that sends none. After
the check comes the timestamp, in the body at the dot path or in a
header, in ms or s, within window of the yard's clock. The signing
secret reaches no command, and an unverified body reaches none. bodies
is unique (no two deliveries share a body), unique-per-hook (no two
deliveries to one hook share a body) or repeat (a body may come again).
normalize turns a verified body into the envelope: stdin {"headers":
{...}, "body": ...}, stdout the envelope, which the core refuses without
a type and sets the source and the delivery of itself. It runs as the
limits command does and is handed no credential. keys are what the
events' fields may carry, which a subscription's --where may then name
beside type, action, team, project, repo and label. Such a file needs no
base and no calls, and with neither has no credential, check or notify
either. Refused: a scheme that is neither hmac-sha256 nor secret,
signed, algorithm, encoding, prefix, list or key with scheme secret, an
algorithm that is none of sha256, sha1 and sha512, a signed
template with a missing or repeated {body} or {timestamp}, a repeated
{delivery}, an unknown placeholder, or {delivery} with no delivery in a
header, signed: body with the timestamp in a header, an encoding that is
neither hex nor base64, a verify key with no encoding, a secret in a
header and in the body, a body secret with scheme hmac-sha256, a
delivery id in a header and in the body, bodies that repeat with no
delivery, a
timestamp in the body and in a header, or in neither, a unit that is not
ms or s, a window that is no positive duration, bodies that are none of
unique, unique-per-hook and repeat, a command that is no list of strings
or has no program, a key that is not lowercase letters, digits and _. A
pack for a depot brings no hook key; a pack of kind source may, with the
normalize file.

A source that tells people and receives can hear only its addresses
back: a hear key drops a delivery from anything but an address a user's
env file sets, after verification, whatever the user is told through.

  hear:
    field: chat
    address: { env: PHONE_CHAT }
    from: operator

fields[field] must hold the address a user's env file sets under
address.env, read as telling reads it; setting the address is the consent
to be heard, and telling is a separate choice. from narrows whom the
source hears to the operator, and is left out for every user whose env
file sets the address. A drop is
answered 200, recorded nowhere and counted beside refusals, so a
stranger's burst is one bounded entry; a delivery that matches is recorded
and routed as today. Refused: a hear without a hook key or a notify key; a
field that is no key of hook.keys; an address that is not the one notify
reads; a from that is not operator. A pack of kind source may bring the
key; a pack for a depot brings no hear key, as it brings no hook key.

A parameter marked log: true has its value kept in the record of each call
(the source_call event), which otherwise has the parameter's name alone: for
what an audit asks by, a customer's id, and never for free text.

Adding, setting and removing a source is the operator's, and is refused from
the pane of an agent: a source is where a credential of the yard is sent,
and its limits command is run by the yard. What calls a declared source is
yardr source check, the daemon for a source a user names as their notify (it
sends the user what landed in their inbox, yardr user set --help), and
yardr call: a call for a session or a crew member the operator granted it,
made by the yard's server.

  yardr source grant crm read --group builders --group reviewers   # every read call
  yardr source grant crm customer --crew yardmaster                # one read call
  yardr source grant crm note --group support                      # one update call
  yardr source grant crm read --crew yardmaster --as ada           # read, made with ada's credential
  yardr source grant google-mail --preset drafts --crew yardmaster # the preset's calls of the source
  yardr source revoke crm read --group reviewers

A grant is kept on its own, by source and grantee, and not in a group's
definition, which yardr group add replaces whole. read is every read call of
the source, one a later file adds included: yardr source add says who gets a
call that is new or changed. An update call is granted by its name and no
other way: there is no word for every update. --preset <name> grants one
preset's calls of the source instead, from the embedded pack that declares
it (yardr pack show <pack> prints a pack's). Granting plainly is the
operator's, and is refused from the pane of an agent whatever --actor says;
a grant --as <user> is that user's to give alone, and the operator is
refused it. Anyone may revoke, by the same words. Removing a source removes
its grants, plain and as a user alike.`,

		Long: `env_file is a file of KEY=VALUE lines that sets the variable the source's
declaration names (credential.env, and credential.update_env where it names
one). It is held to the rule of every env_file:
a regular file of mode 0600 or stricter, read at each call, so rotating the
credential is rewriting the file. The store keeps its path, never what is in
it. A file that is open to others or does not set the name is refused here.
env_file= with nothing after it takes the setting away.

mint_command is the command that turns the mint's inputs into a short-lived
token, where the declaration names a mint (credential.mint): one line, split
on spaces without a shell (quote it for arguments), the program absolute or
on PATH. Name the program by its whole path: the daemon's PATH need not be
your shell's. It is run without a shell, with {inputs, scope} on stdin, and
answers {token, expires_at}; its environment is PATH, HOME, USER, LOGNAME,
the proxy and CA variables the process that runs it has, and
YARDR_SOURCE_BASE, and nothing else of the yard's. The store keeps the line
to be shown, as a crew member's env_command is, so it holds no secret. A
program that is not there is refused here, as is a declaration that names no
mint. A declaration may bring a command of its own (credential.mint_command),
which mints while this is unset: this setting wins over it, and a pack
applied again keeps it. mint_command= with nothing after it takes the
setting away, and the declaration's own mints again.

calls_per_hour is how many calls of the source one session or crew member
makes with yardr call within an hour (` + fmt.Sprint(store.SourceCallLimit) + ` unless set); the call after is
refused until the hour that began with the first has passed.
calls_per_hour= with nothing after it is ` + fmt.Sprint(store.SourceCallLimit) + ` again.

updates_per_hour is how many of those calls are updates (` + fmt.Sprint(store.SourceUpdateLimit) + ` unless set):
an update is counted as a call and as an update, and is refused when either
is used up. updates_per_hour= with nothing after it is ` + fmt.Sprint(store.SourceUpdateLimit) + ` again.

base is which of the declaration's region bases the source's calls go to,
one of the names under its bases key. It is refused where the file declares
none, and a name it has not is refused with the names it has: no free-text
base is accepted, so the credential goes only to a host the file declares.
base= with nothing after it is the declaration's own base again.

host is the host of a server of your own, for a service whose declaration
names a base_template: a name or an address with an optional port and
nothing else (crm.example.net, 192.168.1.20:8443), which fills the template,
so the calls go to https://<host>/ and the path the declaration gives. It is
held to the checks of a base (https, no user, query or fragment), refused
where the file names no template, and typed by the operator alone: an agent
is refused it, on its pane and as a card. host and base replace each other,
and host= with nothing after it is the declaration's own base again. A
credential given for another host is held back from this one, naming both,
until it is given again (yardr source key): setting a host never carries a
key to it.

Setting env_file or base is where a credential comes from and where it is
sent, so it also pairs the credential with the host the source's calls go to
afterwards (see yardr source key), but for a base that takes the source off a
host: that key is held back too.`,

	key := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "key <name> [NAME...]",
		Short: "Give a source's credential: typed without echo, or NAME=value lines on standard input",
		Long: `Writes the value of each variable the source's declaration names for its
credential (credential.env, credential.update_env, the inputs under
credential.mint) into the file the credential is read from, so that nobody
writes that file by hand. The file is the source's env_file, or with none
set ~/.yardr/sources/<name>.env, which is then set as yardr source set
sets it. The yard's server writes it: the line of each name given is
replaced or added, every other line and comment is kept, and the file is
replaced whole, by a rename, with mode 0600. A file that is open to others,
or is a symbolic link, is refused and not repaired.

On a terminal each value is asked for and nothing is shown as it is typed.
Without a NAME every variable of the credential is asked for, and enter
alone leaves one as it is; with NAMEs those are asked for, and each wants a
value. When standard input is no terminal it is read as NAME=value lines, as
an env file's are, which is how a script gives one; with NAMEs the lines
set exactly those. A value is never an argument and never a variable of the
command's environment: every process of the same OS user can read both.

The value is kept in that file and nowhere else: not in the store, an event
or the log, and no command prints it. What is printed is where the
credential is set now, as yardr source show says it. Refused: a name the
declaration does not have, an empty value, one with a line break in it or
white space at either end. It is the operator's, and is refused from the
pane of an agent, as yardr source set is.

The credential is given for the host the source's calls go to now, and the
yard remembers it: while the source's declaration sends to another host, as
a replacement by a pack applied again can, its own calls, yardr source check
and whatever else would send it there are held back, naming both hosts, and
nothing is sent. Restoring the declaration it was given for ends that;
giving the credential again here pairs it with where the calls go then.

With --as <user> it is that user's own credential in the source that is
given, which a call made as them reads: the value goes into the user's
env_file, or with none set into ~/.yardr/users/<user>.env, which is then
set as yardr user set sets it, and every other line is kept. Without a
NAME every name under credential.mint is asked for where the declaration
names a mint, else the static ones, and enter alone leaves one as it is;
with NAMEs those are asked for, and each wants a value. The user gives
their own, or the operator does it for them; it is refused from the pane
of an agent, and for a user the yard does not have. The source needs no
notify key. What is printed names the check that tries it as them.

The file and the store are two writes. When the yard wrote the file and
could not record it, it says so, with the names and the file: give it
again, and it ends as one giving that worked.`,

answer.select, a successful check also prints each selected top-level field
the answer carries, one per line under the status line (and carries the same
object under answer with --json); a field the answer does not carry prints no
line. A source whose file names no check call is sent nothing: its credential
is looked at and that is all. Where the file names a mint (credential.mint),
the token is minted first, with the source's mint_command, and the line says
what it was minted from and how long it is good.

With --as <user> it looks at that user's credential instead, the names a
call as them reads from their env file, and makes the check call as them,
saying so. It is the operator's, as check is.

A source that says limits (a limits key) has its command run once for each
harness kind its file lists, one after the other, and what each answered is
printed as yardr limits prints it. It fails when a kind got no answer, so a
kind whose harness is not logged in on this machine is better left out of
the file. A source that answers for itself has its command run once, for
the source. Each run may take up to ` + limits.Timeout.String() + `.

Of every other command the file names (thread's), check says whether its
program is there and can be run, and fails when one cannot; it runs none.

With --user it tells that user through the source instead: one real
message, a line that says it is a test, sent as everything the yard tells
them will be, with the address their env_file sets. It is the user's own to
ask for, or the operator's, and works before the user names the source as
their notify, to try it first. A crew member that needs one sent proposes
it with a run ask. A source yardr has built in is checked this
way too, once one can tell a person.
