		Use:   "limits [kind|source]",
		Short: "What the subscriptions the yard burns still carry, and what its sources say of themselves",
		Long: `Asks the source of the yard that says limits (a declared source with a
limits key: yardr source --help) what the subscriptions the yard burns
still carry, and prints each window of their usage limits: how far it is
used, when it resets and in how long, and whether it is used up. With a
kind it asks for that one; without, every kind a group, a crew member or
the yard's default_kind names is resolved to its provider — its provider
setting where one is set, else the kinds table's mapping of the kind — and
each provider is asked once, naming who burns it. With --group and no kind
it asks for that group's own: its kind through its provider setting, as a
route's condition reads it.

  yardr limits kimi
  kimi  aiquokka says (provider Kimi):
    5h      100% used (100 of 100)  resets 00:02 (in 42m)             used up
    Weekly  38% used (38 of 100)    resets Sat 10 Oct 09:02 (in 3d 9h)
    an agent of kind kimi waits for the 5h window, which resets 00:02 (in 42m)

  yardr limits
  kimi  aiquokka says (provider Kimi): burned by groups builders, nightshift (kind kimi)
    5h      100% used (100 of 100)  resets 00:02 (in 42m)             used up
    an agent burning kimi waits for the 5h window, which resets 00:02 (in 42m)

A source that answers for itself (a limits key with no kinds: yardr source
--help) is listed beside the providers, each with its windows, and with its
name it is asked for alone:

  yardr limits machine
  machine says (provider machine):
    load  12.5% used (target 80%)  reset not known
    no window is used up

Where the provider says what share of a window has passed, it is printed
beside the used figure, and a window burned past it is marked over target;
a route's quota condition may compare with it (yardr route add --help).

Every run asks: the source's command is run once per provider and once per
source that answers for itself, once for the kind or source with one named,
now, by this command and as whoever runs it, for at most ` + limits.Timeout.String() + ` each.
Nothing is remembered between two runs. A provider may be slow and may be
bounded in how often it answers, so this is a command for when you want to
know, not one to run in a loop.

With --group the command runs with that group's env, as its agents run,
and the answer is for the login the group burns: two groups on different
logins report different windows. Without it the answer is for the login
the provider reads on this machine, which is the operator's; a group whose
env gives its harness another account is not described by it, nor is a
crew member on another login.

A provider is "not known", with the reason, when no source of the yard
names it or when its command gave no answer: another exit status than 0,
nothing within the bound, or output that is not the JSON the yard reads.
A kind that resolves to nothing is not asked, and is named under unmapped.
The exit status is then 1. --json prints, per provider, the burning kinds
and users beside the report under limits, and per source that answers for
itself under sources: the window that is used up and resets last under
window and resets_at, or the reason under limits_unknown.`,
		Example: `  yardr limits
  yardr limits kimi
  yardr limits machine
  yardr limits --group mckean2-builders
  yardr limits kimi --json | jq -r '.limits[0].resets_at'`,
