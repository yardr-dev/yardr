// what matched are routeMatch's; the set-aside lines are route list

routes, every route that matches in order with the ranking leg that
placed it, the routes considered that do not match and why, the
defaults the depot sets aside for the bead's stage, and the winning
route's groups.

Each matching route after the first names the leg that placed it below
the one above: priority, specificity (how much the route asks for: the
type, the depot, the bead priority, each label and a named originator
count as one), own before default, or id.

A bead with no depot is explained against the yard defaults. A bead
that pins a flow is explained as its unpinned twin: routing reads the
stage, type, depot, labels, bead priority and originator, never the
flow, and the pin is named beside the answer it does not change.

The choice among a winning route's groups is made at the claim, from
the windows then; what a claim chose stays where it is, in bead show
and the quota_wait event. The command writes nothing, logs nothing and
asks no provider.`,
