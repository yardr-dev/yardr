		Long: `A harness is logged in with its own login, in a terminal. For a person
who has none, a program (a window such as footplate) leads the login with
--json: yardr runs the harness's own login command, as the kind's file has
it (login_recipe; yardr harness show <kind>), on pipes it holds, and prints
what the login needs next, one JSON object a line:

  {"need":"choose","text":"...","options":["...","..."]}   answered {"choose":"<an option>"}
  {"need":"open_url","url":"https://..."}                  the page to sign in on; no answer
  {"need":"input","text":"...","secret":true}              answered {"input":"<what the page gave>"}
  {"need":"confirm","text":"..."}                          answered {"confirm":true} or false
  {"done":true,"kind":"claude","proved":true,"try":{...}}  the end

The answers are read from stdin, one JSON object a line. Where the yard
runs, an input also waits under the reference its need names as login: a
secret ask naming it (yardr bead ask --secret-login) answers the input the
same way, for a person with no stdin to the leader, and the value is handed
to the login and kept nowhere. The harness opens
the sign-in page itself where it can, and a login made there ends the run
with no input given. Once the login command has ended well, confirm asks
whether to make the one real call yardr doctor --try makes, for this kind
only: it costs a model call, so it is made on a true only, and "proved" says
whether it answered. A login that fails ends with {"error":"..."} and
status 1; so does stdin closing before the login has ended, which stops the
login command. What is put in is passed to the harness and kept nowhere.

Without --json it says what to run in a terminal. Only a kind whose file has
a recipe is led: the recipe is read from what one version of the harness
printed, and may stop matching when the harness prints something else.

With --group the login is led with that group's env: its env_file is read
as the runner reads it for the group's sessions, and the login command and
the proving call run with its entries joined, so the login lands in the
folder the group's env names (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR for Claude Code). A kind
with no recipe is logged in in a terminal with the group's env set
instead. A login made for a group sits in a folder on this machine, which
whoever runs the machine can read: bringing a subscription trusts the
operator the way the machine's own login does.`,
		Example: `  yardr harness login claude          # what to run in a terminal
  yardr harness login claude --json   # for a program: needs on stdout, answers on stdin
  yardr harness login claude --group hal-builders --json   # into that group's folder`,
