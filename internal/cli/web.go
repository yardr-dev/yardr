		Use:   "serve",
		Short: "Serve a view of the yard over HTTP",
		Long: `Serve the yard as web pages: a feed of what happens, the flows of its
depots with the beads in each stage, every bead, what waits for a person, the
running sessions and the crew, live. Without --as, YARDR_WEB_AS or the
web_as setting the view reads the yard and changes nothing. Every page
answers a request with "Accept: application/json" with the data it shows,
and /events streams the yard's events as server-sent events.

It listens on --addr, else on YARDR_WEB_ADDR when set in the command's
environment, else on the yard's web_addr setting (yardr settings set
web_addr <host:port>), else on 127.0.0.1:8791.

By default it listens on loopback only: an address on any other interface
is refused unless --unsafe is given. A request is answered when its Host
header is a loopback name or a name given with --host, and 421 under any
other name.

--unsafe listens on every interface (0.0.0.0:8791, on the selected
address's port, or the --addr given, which may then be any address), to open the view from another machine on
the same network. Outside JWT mode there is still no authentication: anyone
who can reach this machine on that port can read the whole yard. In JWT mode
every request but /health must carry a token the gateway signed. A request is answered
when its Host header is an IP address, a loopback name or this machine's
host name (with or without .local), and 421 under any other name.

--host names a host the machine is reached by and cannot work out by
itself: its name in the LAN's DNS, on a tailnet, or a proxy's. It is
answered as the machine's own names are, in any case and with any port. It
takes one name or a comma list and may be repeated. A wildcard is refused.

Without --unsafe, --host leaves the view on loopback, where such a name
reaches it through a proxy of yours on this machine that forwards the Host
header unchanged. TLS, and who reaches the view, are that proxy's. The view
then answers to the loopback names and the names given, and to nothing it
was not given: not this machine's host name, and no IP address off
loopback. Name only names whose resolution you control: a page under a
name someone else controls could read the yard through a visitor's browser
(docs/web.md, "Behind a proxy").

Beside the view it serves the sandbox origin, where a note's pages run:
a second listener on loopback answering blob bytes only, under a policy
that permits inline scripts and blocks fetches, frames, workers and
popups. WebRTC blocking depends on browser support, and a page opened
top-level can navigate itself (docs/web.md). It listens on
--pages-addr, else on YARDR_WEB_PAGES_ADDR when set in the command's
environment, else on the yard's web_pages_addr setting (yardr settings
set web_pages_addr <host:port>), else on 127.0.0.1:8789, on loopback
like the view and under the same Host rules. A bead's page carries run
beside each page's static link, opening the same bytes there. Behind a
proxy of yours the origin is reached by the name the view was reached
by, on the origin's port, which the proxy forwards beside the view's;
--pages-host names a second name for it instead, which the proxy routes
to the origin and run links use (docs/web.md, "Behind a proxy").

The view acts as --as when it is given, else as YARDR_WEB_AS when set in
the command's environment, else as the yard's web_as setting (yardr
settings set web_as <user>), and reads only with none of them. Whoever it
acts as must be a user of the yard (yardr user list): with any other name
it refuses to start. The talk page then holds the user's conversation with
a crew member or another user, live, with the form that sends it mail as
them, and a bead's
page answers its asks to the user and sends the bead on where it waits for
them, as yardr review offers it. A form's POST is taken only from the
view's own pages, and every other route stays GET. Without a user the talk
page says the view does not act, and the view changes nothing.

A view that acts takes its writes only from a browser that holds its cookie
(docs/web.md, "The token and the cookie"). When it starts it makes a token
of 256 random bits, keeps it in its record under <home>/webviews, a file only
you can read, and prints a URL carrying it (http://127.0.0.1:8791/?token=...)
once, in a terminal and never into a log: open it in your browser, which
trades the token for a cookie and is sent on to the page without it. yardr
web open opens that URL, from the record. A
write without the cookie and the CSRF value of the page it was made from is
refused with 403, and a browser without the cookie reads the yard as a
view with no user does. --unsafe is refused with a user, outside JWT mode:
the token and the cookie would cross the network in the clear.

Behind an auth gateway that forwards each request with a signed JWT proving
who the visitor is, the yard's web_jwt_issuer setting turns JWT mode on
(docs/web.md, "Behind an auth gateway"): every request but /health must
carry the gateway's token, and each request acts as the yard user its email
maps to — two visitors act as themselves on one view. --as, YARDR_WEB_AS
and web_as are then refused at start, and the start line and yardr status
say whose tokens the view verifies (jwt from <issuer>).

The open /events streams are limited: 16 from one address off loopback
(then 429) and 128 from all of them together (then 503), and 128 from
loopback, counted apart, so the network cannot take a stream from a page on
this machine. Both answers carry Retry-After.`,
