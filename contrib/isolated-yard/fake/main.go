// was started with and every line it is sent to agents.log beside its bin
// directory. Started with -p it answers "ok" and exits, or fails, and with a
// file login-needed it waits at a login screen first, and with a file answer
// it says that file's text to every prompt it takes, and with a file busy it
// stays in the turn of a prompt it took (see main). A first
// prompt that asks for a greeting by mail gets one, and with a file run its
