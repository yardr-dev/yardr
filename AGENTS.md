# AGENTS.md

yardr routes beads of work to whoever works them. One Go module
(`yardr.dev/yardr`), one binary, one store (bbolt) with one writer. Start
with `README.md` (concepts) and `.yardr/depot.md` (how this depot is
worked); user docs live in `docs/` and are not repeated here.

## Layout

- `main.go`, `main_test.go`, `yardtest_test.go`: entry (routes to
  `cli.Execute`) and the root black-box suites, over the built binary and
  the test gate itself.
- `internal/`: all Go code, one package per area (below). Nothing outside
  `internal/` imports it except `main` and the tests.
- `docs/`: user and design docs, including `docs/api.md` (the socket API
  contract), `docs/testing.md` (the test rules), `docs/design/`, `docs/flows/`;
  `docs/docs.go` beside them embeds the top-level pages in the binary (`yardr docs`).
- `packs/`: packs shipped inside the binary (`packs/packs.go` embeds them);
  per-service and per-depot-kind directories.
- `harnesses/`: one `<kind>.yaml` per agent harness kind, embedded and read
  by `internal/agents`.
- `contrib/`: operator and developer tools, each with its own README
  (assembly, bench, deploy, github-mint, isolated-yard, machine-limits,
  peer, release, server-yard, shot). google-mint is no longer here: each
  google pack under `packs/` carries it as its declarations' mint command.
- `conformance/bdp`: the BDP conformance suite (`run.sh`, vitest).
- `.yardr/`: the yard's own rules for this depot: `depot.md`, the `test`
  gate, `flows/`, `roles/`, `security_paths` (the paths a reviewer may not
  call `done-safe` for).
- `.github/workflows/`: CI (`ci.yml`) and release.

## Packages (`internal/`)

To find your way inside one, run `go doc -short ./internal/<pkg>` first:
it lists every exported name with its comment, faster than grepping.

- `agents`: what yardr knows of each harness kind (models, login recipes)
  and the fetch data `yardr doctor` reports; not herdr's agent state.
- `bdp`: serves the yard over the Bead Protocol Read profile (HTTP).
- `chat`: the `yardr chat` terminal UI (bubbletea); not the socket API it
  reads through.
- `cli`: cobra commands, one file per area, registered in `root.go`; no
  business logic, which lives in the package the command calls.
- `config`: yard settings, the home layout, `YARDR_*` environment, and
  running operator-configured commands for what they print.
- `depotfile`: reads a depot's standing working-rules file.
- `dispatch`: the daemon's pass: wakes on a committed write, re-reads
  state, routes beads, runs the crew, keeps backups; never polls.
- `diskkeep`: keeping the machine's disk free for landings' builds
  (GOCACHE rotation, stale go-tmp), run by `yardr disk keep`.
- `edgelink`: the yard's side of the edge (`yardr edge connect`): fetching
  the edge's key and enrolling the yard by a code, each call signed with the
  yard's key; the edge itself is the `yardr-hosted` router, not here.
- `eta`: arrival-time estimates and the arrivals board rows.
- `flowdraw`: flows drawn as SVG signalling diagrams (generated into
  `docs/flows/`); the drawing holds no beads.
- `hooks`: receives webhooks (GitHub, Linear, …), routes envelopes into
  yard events; declared-source notifiers live here too.
- `limits`: what a harness subscription still carries, answered by the
  operator's command through a yard source; no provider logic.
- `notify`: one message to a person through the source their record names;
  decides nothing about what is told.
- `otel`: trace context plus a hand-written OTLP/HTTP exporter; no SDK.
- `pack`: reading, checking, planning and applying packs.
- `pairing`: the short-code handshake two yards pair with; no store, no HTTP.
- `peer`: who is on the other end of a unix socket (pid, process tree), so
  the store recognises a call from a session's pane.
- `rpc`: the store API over a local unix socket (`POST /call/<Method>`);
  the client is generated from `store.API`.
- `runner`: starts work: herdr agents and exec commands in worktrees at
  `<root>/<depot>/<bead>`.
- `scripttest`: stand-in scripts for tests (one launcher, symlinks to it).
- `server`: the `yardr server` process: owns the store, serves the socket,
  re-execs itself on upgrade.
- `source`: declared sources: declarations, credentials, mints, calls; the
  operator's provider logic lives in commands, not here.
- `standin`: fake Linear/GitHub APIs and the edge for tests and tryouts,
  written from the services' docs and the design, not recorded.
- `store`: the bbolt store and `API`, the interface everything uses
  (`*Store` in the owning process, `rpc.Client` elsewhere); migrations are
  `migrate_NNN_*.go`.
- `storetest`: throwaway stores for tests; with `YARDR_TEST_RPC=1` they
  talk over a real unix socket.
- `udiff`: one unified-diff rendering shared by history and ask cards.
- `version`: build identity, and noticing when the binary was replaced.
- `web`: the browser UI: server-rendered pages plus htmx; routes in
  `server.go`, CSS/JS in `assets/`.
- `yardkey`: a yard's keypair, invites, and peer signatures; no
  store, no HTTP servers.
- `yards`: talking to peer yards (caller and receiver sides).

## Where to start

- New command: a method on `*app` in `internal/cli/<area>.go` returning a
  `*cobra.Command`, registered in `root.go`'s `AddCommand`; interactive
  forms use `huh` (see `groupform.go`), output goes through `a.out` so
  `--json` holds.
- New socket call: a method on `store.API` in `internal/store/api.go`,
  implemented on `*Store`; `go generate ./internal/rpc` rewrites the
  client, and the server exposes it as `POST /call/<Method>` by
  reflection (`internal/rpc/server.go`). If programs outside yardr may
  rely on it, add it to `Calls` in `internal/rpc/api.go` and `docs/api.md`.
- New web page: a handler in `internal/web/<area>.go` plus a route in
  `server.go`'s `routes()`; static files live in `internal/web/assets/`.
- New TUI: the bubbletea model in `internal/chat/`; the command that opens
  it is in `internal/cli/chat.go`.
- New pack: a directory under `packs/` plus its name in the `//go:embed`
  line in `packs/packs.go`.
- New harness kind: `harnesses/<kind>.yaml`; `agents.Harness` in
  `internal/agents` says what each field means.
- New store migration: `internal/store/migrate_NNN_<name>.go`, following
  the previous one.

## Conventions

- Comments explain why, in full sentences, beside the code they justify;
  names match their neighbours. Prefer extending what is there over a new
  concept, flag or special case.
- Errors are lowercase prose built with `fmt.Errorf`, context outside and
  `%w` inside; expected cases are sentinels (`ErrNotFound`) that callers
  match with `errors.Is`.
- Files are lowercase, one area per file; tests live beside the code as
  `*_test.go`.
- Fixtures: throwaway stores from `internal/storetest`, stand-in scripts
  from `internal/scripttest`; wait on the effect, not on wall time.
- The test rules are `docs/testing.md` (per-package time budget, sleep
  budget, parallelism); the gate is `sh .yardr/test` in the worktree, and
  its printed `test:` line is the record of a run.
- `gofmt` and `go vet` are clean on every change; the module builds with
  the Go in `go.mod`.

## What not to touch

- `internal/rpc/client_gen.go`: generated; change `internal/store/api.go`
  and run `go generate ./internal/rpc`.
- `docs/flows/*.svg`: generated by `internal/flowdraw/gen`; change the
  flows or `internal/flowdraw`.
- Git-ignored build outputs (`/yard`, `*.test`, `/dist`,
  `conformance/bdp/node_modules/`); there is no `vendor/` directory.
- `.yardr/depot.md` holds the yard's rules for builders. One of them: a
  change that moves or adds a package updates this map (AGENTS.md) in the
  same commit.
