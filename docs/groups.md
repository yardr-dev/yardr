# Groups and runners

A group is who works a stage's beads: a pool of agents, a code step, or
humans. Its runner says how work starts; routes (`yardr route add`) send a
stage's beads to it. What a group's settings are, and where they are kept,
is in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Groups, interactively

`yardr group add` with no name opens a form: pick an existing group to edit or
create one, choose the runner, and for herdr the agent (Claude Code, Codex,
Grok, Kimi, opencode, pi, or any other herdr agent), a model read live from
that agent (press `/` to search long lists), and its permission flags. With a
name, `yardr group add <name> --runner … --set …` stays scriptable.

## Runners

| runner | starts | config |
|---|---|---|
| `manual` | nothing; the bead waits on the group | — |
| `exec` | `sh -c cmd` in the rig, with `YARDR_BEAD`, `YARDR_SESSION`, `YARDR_STAGE`, `YARDR_GROUP`, `YARDR_ACTOR` (the group); for a bead with a rig also `YARDR_RIG`, `YARDR_RIG_PATH`, `YARDR_BASE` (what the bead lands on: the rig's base, or its epic's branch, see [pipeline.md](pipeline.md#epics)), `YARDR_BRANCH` (`yard/<bead>`), `YARDR_WORKTREE` (where herdr groups check that branch out); and `YARDR_BIN`, `YARDR_HOME` for the script's own `yardr` commands; `YARDR_RIG_KIND` is `git`, or `dir` for a dir rig, whose beads get no base, branch or worktree. A refinery is one ([pipeline.md](pipeline.md#4-approved-the-refinery-lands-it-on-main)), and so is rig yard's `yard-integrators`, which integrates an epic's branch once its children have landed ([pipeline.md](pipeline.md#the-epics-own-flow)) | `cmd`, `dir`, `log`, `worktrees` |
| `herdr` | a herdr worktree workspace on branch `yard/<bead>` (from the bead's base) at `~/.yardr/worktrees/<rig>/<bead>` (reopened for later stages, one tab per stage), an agent in it, in a tab of its own with `YARDR_ACTOR` (the agent), `YARDR_BEAD`, `YARDR_SESSION`, `YARDR_STAGE`, `YARDR_GROUP`, `YARDR_BASE` (what it branches from: the rig's base, or its epic's branch), `YARDR_HOME` and `YARDR_BIN` in its environment, prompted with a brief in the worktree's git dir (`git rev-parse --git-path yardr`); a dir rig's bead works in the directory itself (see [Dir rigs](#dir-rigs)) | `kind`, `prompt`, `args`, `keep`, `worktrees`, `idle`, `max_age`, `grace`, `label`, `env_file` |

### Dir rigs

A dir rig ([configuration.md](configuration.md#rig-kinds-git-and-dir)) is a plain directory,
with no git, base or branches, so its beads are worked in the directory
itself. A herdr group opens a workspace there for the bead (`herdr
workspace create --cwd <dir>`, labelled as any bead's; later stages reuse
it while it is open), a tab per stage with `YARDR_RIG` and `YARDR_RIG_PATH`
in place of `YARDR_BASE`, and writes the brief to `<dir>/.yardr/briefs/`.
The brief says to work in the directory directly, commit nothing, touch
only what the bead names and say in the note what was produced, by path.
Once the bead closes its briefs are removed and its workspace closed; the
directory is left as it is, so there is nothing to `keep`. An exec group
runs in the directory with `YARDR_RIG_KIND=dir` and no `YARDR_BASE`,
`YARDR_BRANCH` or `YARDR_WORKTREE` (not even ones the daemon inherited).
Epics there only group: no epic branch is made and children work in the
same directory. The integrator, refinery and pull request scripts in
`contrib/refinery` work on branches, so a dir rig's flow must not route to
them (routes are per rig): its epic flow sends `open` to reviewers instead,
and each script refuses a dir rig's bead with exit 2 as a guard. Several
beads may work the same directory at once; the group's `limit` is the only
control, so set it to 1 where their files could collide.

A session ends when the bead is advanced, closed or released. If the runner
reports the work gone (process exited, herdr agent gone) the session is marked
`died` and the bead is routed again after a backoff; after 3 failures in one
stage the bead is held (`yardr bead unhold` grants fresh attempts).
A runner that cannot start anything (herdr missing or down) is an outage, not
a failure of the bead: the group backs off and logs `runtime_down` once.
Groups can also limit how long a session sits idle or runs (`idle`,
`max_age`, `grace`; [configuration.md](configuration.md#session-limits-and-outages)).

### The prompt

A herdr group's `prompt` is the role its agents start from, at the head of
their brief. `--set prompt=roles/builder.md` reads the rig's own
`.yardr/roles/builder.md` as it is on the rig's base branch (a bead cannot
change its own reviewer's prompt), else the generic
`~/.yardr/roles/builder.md` that `yardr init` installed; an absolute path is
read as is. The order and the older rig-root `roles/` are in
[configuration.md](configuration.md#role-prompts).

### Outbound credentials

A herdr group whose agents need a credential to act outside the yard (a
review bot's GitHub token, say) names an env file with `--set
env_file=~/.config/yardr/groups/<group>.env`. The rules are the residents'
([residents.md](residents.md#outbound-credentials)): `KEY=VALUE` lines, `#`
comments, no expansion, mode `0600` or stricter, and the store never holds
the values (BDP serves it, backups copy it, every builder reads it). Each
entry joins the agent's tab environment next to `YARDR_ACTOR` and the rest;
a key yardr sets itself is ignored.

```sh
yardr group add yard-codex-review --runner herdr --set kind=codex … \
  --set env_file=~/.config/yardr/groups/codex-review.env
```

A file that is missing, not a regular file or open to others stops the
group, not the bead: nothing is created, the session is aborted without
counting against the bead, and the group backs off and logs `runtime_down`
once with the reason, as for a runtime outage, until the file is fixed.

### herdr setup

- **Folder trust.** Claude Code asks to trust each new project, and every bead's
  worktree is its own git root, so trusting a parent folder does not cover them:
  each builder stops at the trust dialog until someone answers it in its pane.
  yardr keeps such a session (`session_blocked` in `yardr watch`) and sends its
  first prompt once it is answered. Starting without the dialog is yard-16.
- **Decide what agents may run unattended.** Anything outside `args`'
  permissions blocks the agent on a prompt. Pass what the role needs, e.g.
  `--set 'args=["--permission-mode","acceptEdits","--allowedTools","Bash(yardr:*),Bash(git:*)"]'`;
  compound shell commands still prompt unless allowed or auto mode is on.
- **Blocked agents are reported.** When herdr sees an agent waiting on a
  prompt, yardr writes a `session_blocked` event (visible in `yardr watch`);
  answer it in herdr and the session carries on.
- **Worktrees are cleaned up when the bead closes**, not when a stage ends,
  so later stages reuse them. A worktree with uncommitted or untracked changes
  is kept (a `workspace_kept` event says why) and `yard/<bead>` branches are
  never deleted. Set `--set cleanup=false` on a group to keep its worktrees.
  Reopening a bead checks its branch out again.
- **Labels.** herdr nests each workspace under its rig's node, so labels
  leave the rig out: a bead's workspace is `<group> [<epic>] <bead>` (the
  epic only for a child of one) and its stage's tab `<stage> [<epic>]
  <bead>`, with `yard-` trimmed from `yard-sv6b`: `builders [sv6b] p4cv`
  and `new [sv6b] p4cv`, or `builders cbdc` and `new cbdc`. An id that does
  not start with `<rig>-` stays whole, and ids everywhere else in yardr stay
  full. The group appears as its `label` config when set (`--set
  label=codex` on `yard-codex-review` gives `codex [sv6b] p4cv`), else as
  its name without the `<rig>-` prefix. Residents' workspaces are labelled
  with the resident's name.
- The daemon subscribes to herdr's event stream, so an agent that exits is
  noticed within a second; the reconcile timer remains the fallback.
