# The edge: webhooks with no open port

The edge is the service at `https://my.yardr.dev` that stands in front of
yards. A yard that is connected to it takes its webhooks through it: GitHub,
Linear, Slack and the rest post to `https://my.yardr.dev/hooks/<handle>/<hook>`,
and the edge hands each delivery to the yard connected under that handle. The
yard dials out, so a laptop on any network, with no open port and no tunnel of
its own, is reachable for webhooks and for its devices' calls. What the edge
hands over of a delivery is the sender's raw body and headers, and the yard
verifies every delivery itself, with secrets only it holds. Today the edge
carries webhooks and devices' calls.

```sh
yardr edge connect https://my.yardr.dev   # fetch the edge's key, show it, enrol by a code
yardr edge status                          # what this yard is connected to, and how its link is
yardr edge disconnect                      # leave the edge, and put back the hook address from before
```

A connected yard is a yard you run on your own machine that keeps one link
open to the edge. A hosted yard is a yard the service runs for you
([below](#hosted-and-connected)). Both take webhooks at the same URLs, and
both are on the trial's invite list. People who have no yard of their own
read the same on the edge's public notice,
`https://my.yardr.dev/edge/notice`, which needs no sign-in.

## Connecting a yard

Only the operator connects a yard, and a yard connects to one edge at a time.

```text
$ yardr edge connect https://my.yardr.dev
The edge's key: ed25519:9bR…T1  (fetched over HTTPS from my.yardr.dev; compare it with https://yardr.dev/edge)
This yard's key: ed25519:Hk3…q9
Open https://my.yardr.dev/connect and enter the code  WQ4F-7K2M
Waiting for you to approve this yard there. Ctrl+C stops, and writes nothing.
… approved by you@example.net as mckean
Connected: webhooks reach this yard at https://my.yardr.dev/hooks/mckean/<hook>
hook_public_url set to https://my.yardr.dev/hooks/mckean
The server opens the link to the edge now: yardr edge status says when it is up.
```

**The first step is trust.** The yard has no edge key yet, so the command
fetches it over HTTPS, with the system's certificate checks, before anything
is signed, and prints it. Whoever holds a valid certificate for the address at
that moment is taken for the edge. A plain `http` address is refused except
on this machine, for a stand-in. After that moment the pin holds on its own:
a different certificate, a different machine behind the name, or a different
key served later moves nothing, and the link refuses an edge that cannot sign
with the pinned key. It is trust on first use, as `ssh` does with a host
key, with the web's certificates making the first use hard to intercept. A
person who does not want to take the certificate's word compares the printed
key with the one published at `https://yardr.dev/edge`, a page outside the
edge's own hosting.

**Then the yard enrols.** It sends its public key and its name, signed to the
pinned key, and gets a code back. You sign in at `/connect` and enter the
code, and the page shows the yard's name and the start of its key before you
approve it. You type and paste nothing on this machine: the yard's key is its
credential, and every answer from the edge is checked against the pinned key.
Connecting takes the trial's invite, as a hosted yard does: an account whose
email is not on the list is refused.

**Connecting sets two settings.** The `edge` setting holds the edge's
address, its pinned key, the handle, and the `hook_public_url` it replaced
([configuration.md](configuration.md#settings)). `hook_public_url` becomes
`<url>/hooks/<handle>`, so `yardr hook add` and the packs that register their
own webhooks print or register the right URL with no change. The running
server dials at once; no restart. `yardr status` and `yardr doctor` show the
link beside the listener's, and the server logs `edge_link_up` and
`edge_link_down`, with why a link went down.

**Disconnecting puts it back.** `yardr edge disconnect` asks the edge to drop
its row for the yard, clears `edge`, and restores the `hook_public_url` from
before connecting, or clears it when there was none. One you changed after
connecting stays as you left it. The settings are cleared whether or not the
edge answers; when it does not, the command says so, and its row waits for
its operator.

## What the edge reads, and what it never holds

TLS ends at Cloudflare and at the router, so the edge reads every webhook
payload and its headers, and the yard's answer, in the clear. A device's
calls pass it in the clear too
([below](#footplate-through-the-link)). The yard-key
signatures prove who sent a frame; they hide nothing. Nothing through the
edge is end-to-end encrypted.

It never holds:

- **repositories**: git runs from the yard to GitHub directly, never through
  the link;
- **hook signing secrets**: they are in the yard's secret files, and the yard
  verifies every delivery itself; the edge cannot verify one;
- **the yard's private key**: the key never leaves the yard's machine;
- **model credentials of a connected yard**: the harness logs in on the
  person's machine.

For a hosted yard the service keeps no harness credential either: the person
signs each login in, and states at sign-up that their provider's terms allow
that use. The edge's public notice says the same for both kinds of yard, for
people who have no yard of their own.

Peers are never carried through the edge: two linked yards call each other
directly, as [peers.md](peers.md) says. A device's calls are carried
through the same link ([below](#footplate-through-the-link)).

## footplate through the link

A device of yours, such as footplate, the native window over a yard, reaches
a connected yard through the same link, with no listener of the yard's own.
`yardr user device pair <user> footplate` counts a link that is up as a
listener and gives the edge's address with the code, so pairing is pairing
by code as on the LAN: the device is given the address and the code, and
asks once for its token
([users.md](users.md#enrolled-by-a-code)).

Two gates, as for a hosted yard: the edge's (your account's session) and the
yard's (the device's token). Every call but the stream waits up to 30
seconds for the yard's answer; past that, or with no link up, the edge
answers 504 or 503 and keeps nothing: a device asks again, and only
webhooks are queued. `GET /user/events` stays open as it does on the
listener; while nothing arrives for 30 seconds the edge writes an empty
line, which is no event and which a client skips
([api.md](api.md#the-stream-of-a-device)).

What the edge reads of it: every call and its answer — conversations, beads,
mail, asks, notes — and the device token each call carries, with which the
edge could act as that device within what the device may do. The edge is
ours and connecting is invite-only, and a token is revoked per device on the
yard: `yardr user device rm <user> <device>`.

Never over the link: model credentials and hook signing secrets, and the
calls that carry them, `GiveSecret`, `ApproveAsk` and `ApproveSetup`. Those
are answered at the yard's own machine, as on a LAN without TLS.

## Hosted and connected

| | hosted yard | connected yard |
|---|---|---|
| account, handle, sign-up | the edge's, by invite | the same |
| webhook URL | `https://my.yardr.dev/hooks/<handle>/<hook>` | the same |
| how the edge reaches it | TCP to its container or droplet | the link the yard opened |
| footplate | Kratos session plus device token, pairing by code | the same, through the link |
| who runs it, upgrades, backs up | the service | the person |
| invite list | yes, for the trial | yes, the same list |

One account holds one yard for now, chosen once: connecting is refused while
a hosted yard exists, and the other way round, until the old one is gone (a
hosted yard is deleted by the operator on request; a connected one leaves
with `yardr edge disconnect`).

## While the yard is away: the queue

The edge forwards live first: with the yard connected, it sends the delivery
down the link and waits up to 2 seconds for the answer, which it passes back
to the sender byte for byte. That keeps the yard's own answers working: a
handshake answered from the verified body, a 401 for a bad signature, a 200
for a dropped stranger. With the yard not connected, or no answer in time,
the edge keeps the delivery and answers the sender `202` with the queued
entry's id. GitHub does not redeliver on its own, so keeping it is the only
way it is not lost. On reconnect the edge sends the queue oldest first; the
yard serves each and sends `ack` once it is recorded or refused, and only
then does the edge delete it. A live frame that ran out of time is the same
queued entry: if the yard's answer arrives later, it counts as that entry's
ack.

**What bounds the queue.** Anyone on the internet can post to a hook URL, and
the edge cannot tell a real delivery from junk, since only the yard holds the
secret. So every bound is checked before the `202`, and a request past one is
refused, never kept:

- **a body of at most 1 MiB**, the yard's own limit; a larger one is answered
  `413`, live or away;
- **per yard, at most 1,000 deliveries and 64 MiB queued**, and nothing kept
  past 7 days;
- **across the edge, at most 2 GiB queued**, so one yard's flood cannot fill
  the disk the edge lives on.

Past a per-yard or edge-wide bound the edge answers `503` with
`X-Edge-Refusal: queue-full` and keeps what it has: the newest is refused
rather than the oldest dropped, so a stranger's flood pushes no real delivery
out. Entries older than 7 days are dropped. The numbers are the router's
flags.

**Junk in the queue, accepted for the trial.** The bounds cap what a stranger
can cost the edge, but not what they can cost one yard: while a yard is away,
anyone who knows its handle can post junk to its hook URLs until its queue is
full, and its real deliveries are then refused until the junk is delivered
(and refused by the yard) or expires. That risk is accepted for the trial,
with two guards: the [Cloudflare rule](#the-edges-operator-the-cloudflare-rule)
below, which slows any one sender, and an event to the edge's operator, at
the first refusal for a yard and then at most one an hour, through the
router's notify command or its log. Each refusal and each drop is counted on
the yard's row.

**Twice, for a hook with no delivery id.** A delivery can reach the yard
twice: an ack lost with the link, or a late live answer beside the queued
copy. The yard catches the second with its existing dedupe, and that holds
only for a hook whose delivery has a key: the sender's delivery id, or a body
the source declares unique. A hook with neither, a `token` hook whose sender
sends no id, is recorded twice. For those hooks the link delivers at least
once, not exactly once, and the person who wants one record per delivery has
the sender send an id. The edge does not dedupe for them: judging which two
bodies are one delivery is the yard's knowledge.

**A queued delivery's timestamp.** A declared source may refuse a delivery
whose timestamp is further than its window from now, which would fail every
queued delivery on arrival. So for a queued frame the yard checks the
sender's timestamp against the edge-signed time the edge received it, instead
of its own clock. The window keeps its job at the edge's door instead of the
yard's, with the stated limit that the edge could replay a captured delivery
with a fresh time.

**Save a Slack URL with the yard connected.** Slack sends `url_verification`
when the URL is saved in its app settings, and expects the challenge back in
the answer. The edge never answers a handshake, since it cannot verify one,
so one that arrives while the yard is away is queued and answered `202`, and
Slack shows the URL as not verified. Save the URL with the yard connected,
which is when the hook is being set up anyway, and save it again if Slack
refuses.

## The edge's operator: the Cloudflare rule

The rule is set in Cloudflare's dashboard, not in code: zone `yardr.dev` >
Security > WAF > Rate limiting rules > Create. It is the zone's one
rate-limiting rule. The zone is on Cloudflare's Free plan, whose
rate-limiting rules match on the path alone, count by IP, and count and block
over a fixed 10 seconds:

- **expression:** `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/hooks/")`
- **count by IP**, 100 requests per 10 seconds
- **action:** Block for 10 seconds

The period and the block are the Free plan's fixed 10 seconds; the count is
proposed. It covers `/hooks/` on every host of the zone, not only
my.yardr.dev; no other host of the zone serves `/hooks/` today, so the wider
scope costs nothing now, and whoever adds one reads this first.

The rule is best effort. Cloudflare counts requests per data center, and
enforcement can lag
(`https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/`),
so a short burst past the count still reaches the edge. That fits the
queue-abuse risk accepted for the trial above. The rule is set before a yard
is pointed at the edge, so junk is throttled before it reaches the queue.
