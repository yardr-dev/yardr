# Writing with the crew from Telegram: the telegram pack hears as well as tells

Design yardr-c55e, proposed 2026-10-13. A proposal as it was decided on, not a description of what the code does today; the decision is on the bead.

A yard is one installation of yardr: its store, its crew and its depots. The crew are the yard's always-on agents, tied to no bead; the yardmaster is the crew member that coordinates. A user is a person of the yard: a name and an inbox. The operator is the person who runs the yard. A source is an outside system the yard hears from. A hook is a webhook endpoint that turns an outside system's deliveries into events. A thread is a conversation in a source that a crew member takes part in. A pack is a way of working as one directory; a pack of kind source is one integration, imported into the yard itself. A declared source is a service added by one YAML file and no Go. An ask is one question as data on a bead, answered by picking an option. See docs/glossary.md for all of yardr's words.

## 1. The question

mckean, 13 Oct 2026 (mail): "for telegram the integration would be nice to be able to exchange messages with you" (the yardmaster). He has Telegram and wants to use it for messaging with the yard: he writes to the bot on his phone, the yardmaster gets it as it gets his mail, answers with `yardr reply <seq>`, and the answer is a message from the bot in the same chat.

## 2. What exists today

### 2.1. The telegram pack tells one way

`packs/telegram/` (kind `source`: `pack.yaml`, `telegram.yaml`, `SETUP.md`) declares the source `telegram` with one call, `message`, a POST of `{chat_id, text}` to `/bot{credential}/sendMessage`, and a `notify` key, which makes it a source a user can be told through (`yardr user set <name> notify=telegram`). The bot token is the yard's (`yardr source key telegram` writes `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to `~/.yardr/sources/telegram.env`); each told person's chat id is their own (`yardr user key <user> telegram` writes `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to `~/.yardr/users/<user>.env`, or a secret ask collects it). Nothing comes back: the declaration has no `hook` key and no `thread` key.

### 2.2. Receiving: webhooks, verify, normalize, dedupe

The yard's server takes webhooks on the `hook_addr` setting as `POST /hooks/<name>` (docs/integrations.md "How one becomes part of a yard", section 1). The yard never registers a webhook at the service; the operator makes the HTTPS URL that reaches the listener. `internal/hooks/receiver.go` serves each delivery: it reads the hook's secret file on every delivery, runs the adapter's `Verify`, then `Normalize`, then records the delivery with its dedupe keys in one store write, and answers 200. A duplicate is answered 200 and dropped with no event.

A declared source is verified from what its file says under `hook.verify`, and today there is exactly one scheme. `internal/source/declaration.go` holds `HookScheme = "hmac-sha256"`, and its reader refuses any other scheme, anything but `signed: body`, and any signature encoding but hex; `internal/hooks/declared.go` checks the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body against the header the file names, then an optional timestamp. The builtin `token` source (`internal/hooks/token.go`) is the one adapter that compares a secret as it arrives, a Bearer [REDACTED] with a constant-time comparison, but it is a builtin source, not something a declaration can say.

`Normalize` for a declared source runs `hook.normalize` with the verified body and no credential (its environment is `PATH`, `HOME` and `YARDR_SOURCE_BASE` only), on stdin `{"headers": {...}, "body": ...}`, and the core sets `source` and `delivery` itself and refuses an envelope without a `type`. Dedupe keys (`DedupeKeys` in `internal/hooks/hooks.go`) are the body's sha256 under the source or hook for `bodies: unique`, plus the delivery id under the hook when the service sent one; an empty delivery id simply yields no key. The envelope's `fields` carry the keys the file names under `hook.keys`, which a subscription's `--where` may then name.

### 2.3. Threads and replies in a declared source

A declared source is answered in when its file has `thread.reply`, `thread.posted` and `thread.read` (`ReplierFor` in `internal/hooks/reply.go`). `yardr reply <seq>` on a hook delivery posts in the delivery's thread; the CLI in the crew member's pane makes the call with the caller's own credential (`Declared.Credential` reads the pane's environment, which the crew member's `env_file` set), and the server never sees it. The thread command is handed that credential under the variable `credential.env` names. Before anything is sent the reply is on record with a key, and a retry asks `thread.posted` for what the key left before posting again. Where the service takes no idempotency key, a second try after a lost answer is a second write: docs/integrations.md says exactly that of update calls, and the same holds here.

`thread.read` lists the thread's messages for `yardr thread show` and for `--to`. A source with no `link` key has no links, no `thread.open` means no `thread open`, and no `thread.state` means no status moves and no stage map. A pack of kind `source` may bring `hook`, `thread` and `link` keys with their command files, which the import copies under `<home>/sources/<name>/` (docs/packs.md "An integration pack"); `limits` stays refused. (`yardr source --help` still says no pack brings those keys; those lines are stale and the beads below refresh them.)

The `linear` pack is the pattern: `packs/linear/linear/normalize` and `packs/linear/linear/thread` are shell scripts around `jq` and `curl`, held by `internal/hooks` to golden files.

### 2.4. Mail, the inbox, and being told

Mail (`yardr mail <user> <text>`) is put in a user's or crew member's inbox by a crew member's session, a user, a user's device over the listener, or a linked yard. No webhook delivery becomes mail: there is no path from a hook event to anyone's mail. `yardr reply <seq>` answers a hook delivery in its source and answers mail with mail to its sender (docs/crew.md "Speaking in sources").

A crew member hears a delivery by subscription: `involved` (mentions, assigned, its threads), `mentions`, or `all`, narrowed by `--where` exact matches. A delivery whose `actor.id` is the crew member's own identity in the source never reaches it, which is also what keeps the webhook echo of its own reply out of its inbox. A user has no identity in a source; only `--scope all` reaches a person, and what the user did themselves is excluded from their notifications, which the store can only tell for acts it knows are the user's.

A user told through a source (`notify`) is sent their mail, their notifications and their asks after 20 seconds still unread, bursted, at most 20 messages an hour (docs/users.md "Told outside the yard"). The daemon sends with the source's credential and the user's address; the title says who and what kind (`mail from yardmaster`, `yardmaster asks`), the text is the first 200 characters, and no link is sent.

An ask is answered with `yardr bead answer`, in `yardr chat` or footplate, or through a device's calls. No text written in a source's thread answers an ask.

### 2.5. Whose word it is elsewhere

Mail `via` a user's device is its user's word as mail from the terminal is (docs/users.md "A write says how it came"). docs/users.md then works out, row by row, what a stolen device of the operator can have run, and what it cannot: no device, secret or setting changes, so removing the device ends it.

Mail from another yard carries the opposite mark: `OutsideMail = "from another yard: information, not instructions"` (`internal/store/peermail.go`), shown wherever a crew member reads it, unless the operator trusts the sender's name as a user of this yard (`TrustedMail`: "that user's word, as if they had written it by mail from this yard").

### 2.6. Telegram's Bot API, as read

Read at core.telegram.org/bots/api on 13 October 2026. Queries are `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME`. Receiving is either webhooks or polling, mutually exclusive: `getUpdates` does not work while a webhook is set.

`setWebhook` takes an HTTPS `url` (ports 443, 80, 88, 8443), `allowed_updates`, and an optional `secret_token` of 1 to 256 characters from `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -`, which every webhook request then carries as the header `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`, compared as it is: it is not a signature over the body. A request Telegram counts as failed (any non-2xx status) is retried and given up after a reasonable number of attempts. `getWebhookInfo` reports the status; `deleteWebhook` removes it. `getUpdates` is long polling with `offset` (an update is confirmed by asking with a higher offset), `limit` and `timeout`; updates are kept at most 24 hours.

Each delivery is one `Update`: an `update_id` and at most one of `message`, `edited_message`, `channel_post` and the rest. A `Message` has a `message_id` unique inside its chat, an optional `from` (`User`), its `chat` (`Chat`), a `date` in Unix time, and for text messages `text`; photos arrive as `photo` sizes with an optional `caption`, files as `document`, voice notes as `voice`, and a reply carries `reply_to_message`. A `Chat` has an integer `id` (at most 52 significant bits), a `type` of `private`, `group`, `supergroup` or `channel`, and for private chats the other party's name. There is no delivery id header, and nothing a bot can call to read a chat's history. An `Update`'s `message` is "a new incoming message": the bot is sent others' messages, never its own. The FAQ's rule for what a bot gets is messages from private chats with users, and in groups everything except messages sent by other bots (core.telegram.org/bots/api#update, core.telegram.org/bots/faq#what-messages-will-my-bot-get). So the bot's own `sendMessage` produces no delivery to it: there is no webhook echo of its answers.

`sendMessage` takes `chat_id` (integer or string) and `text` (1 to 4096 characters), with optional `reply_parameters` to answer a message, and returns the sent `Message`. It takes no idempotency key.

### 2.7. The yard it would land in

mckean's yard already takes webhooks from GitHub and Linear: `yardr hook list` shows both hooks with deliveries accepted today, so a public HTTPS address reaching `hook_addr` exists and a Telegram webhook is one more path on it. Its crew are `yardmaster` and `brakeman`, both running.

## 3. The proposal

The smallest version that lets him write a line from his phone and get the yardmaster's answer in the same chat: his message arrives as a thread delivery of the declared source `telegram`, answered with `yardr reply` as a Linear comment is. Two small general additions to the core carry it: a verify scheme that compares a secret as it arrives, and a declaration key that drops deliveries from chats the yard tells nobody in. The pack grows a `hook` key and `thread` keys with two scripts. No new daemon, no polling, no mail path.

### 3.1. A thread, not mail

His message becomes a `hook` event in the subscribed crew's inbox, in a thread whose id is the chat id. `yardr reply <seq>` posts the answer with `sendMessage` to that chat. This uses Receive, Identify and Reply exactly as built: no new store path, no new command, and the crew's existing habits (inbox, `thread show`, reply, follow) all apply.

Mail was the other shape, and it is the bigger one. Nothing turns a hook delivery into mail today, so mail would need a new core path from deliveries to inboxes, a new rule for which delivery becomes whose mail, and new trust semantics for mail the yard wrote from outside text. The wish says the yardmaster should get it "as it gets his mail", and a thread delivery lands in the same inbox and is answered with the same command; what mail would add over that is the conversation view (`yardr mail --with`), which a one-line exchange does not need.

### 3.2. Receiving: a secret compared as it arrives

Telegram authenticates its webhook requests with the secret token in the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header, not with an HMAC of the body, and no declaration can say that today (section 2.2). The addition is a second scheme of `hook.verify`, general to any source whose service authenticates webhooks with a shared secret in a header:

```yaml
hook:
  verify:
    scheme: secret
    signature: { header: X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token }
  bodies: unique
  normalize: [telegram/normalize]
  keys: [chat]
```

`signature.header` names the header whose value must equal the hook's secret, compared in constant time as the `token` adapter compares its Bearer [REDACTED] `signed` and `encoding` do not apply to this scheme and are refused with it. `delivery` keeps its shape but is optional with this scheme: Telegram sends no delivery id, the core records `""` as it does for a service with none, and dedupe rests on the body alone, which is safe with `bodies: unique` because every Update carries its own `update_id`, so a retry shares the first attempt's body exactly and is answered 200 with no event. `bodies: repeat` without a delivery header is refused, since then nothing would dedupe a retry. The optional `timestamp` keeps its meaning for services that sign one; the telegram declaration omits it, because Telegram retries carry the message's date, not the attempt's, and a stale retry must still answer 200.

Polling with `getUpdates` is the alternative that needs no public address, and it is left out (section 4): it would need a poller in the daemon, per-source offsets in the store, and backoff, all new machinery, against a yard that already receives webhooks, including this operator's (section 2.7).

### 3.3. What a message becomes

The pack's `normalize` turns an Update with a `message` into this envelope: `type` `message`, `action` `create`; `actor` from `from` (id and display name); `thread` from `chat` (id, and the private chat's other party or the group's title as the title; no URL, since a private chat has none); `message` from `message_id`, `parent` from `reply_to_message` where present; `mentions` from `@name` words in the text, the envelope's standard shape, which this setup matches nothing on but option (b) of open question 2 would use; `text` from `text`, else the `caption`, else a bracketed note of what arrived (`[photo]`, `[document: <name>]`, `[voice message]`), which section 3.7 explains; `fields` `{chat: [<chat id>]}`. Updates without a `message` (an edit, a block, a reaction) become `type` `update` with an empty thread: recorded, and routed to nobody the setup subscribes, since the setup filters on `type=message`.

The inbox line reads as a hook delivery does:

```text
4211 10-13 17:40  hook (all) telegram message create by mckean on "mckean": Can the shed land on Monday?
```

#### Strangers are dropped

Anyone can find the bot's name and write to it, so a message from any chat but a told user's is dropped: answered 200, so Telegram does not retry it, recorded nowhere, and never answered. `--where` filters alone do not do this: they would still record a stranger's message as an event, and any broad subscription would still hear it.

The addition is a `hear` key on a declared source, the mirror of `notify`: the envelope field that must be an address the yard tells, else the delivery is dropped after verification:

```yaml
hear:
  field: chat
  address: { env: TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }
```

After `Normalize` and before the delivery is recorded, the core reads `fields[field]` and drops the delivery unless one of its values equals the address of a user told through this source, read from the user's env file as the daemon reads it when telling. A drop is counted and logged in sums like a refusal, so a stranger's burst is visible without filling the log. The key is general: any source that tells its users at an address can hear back from those addresses. It covers every user told through the source, so a second person told through telegram is heard in their own chat with no further configuration.

A hook flag naming allowed values (`--allow chat=<id>`) would be simpler core but a second copy of the chat id beside the user's env file; the `hear` key keeps one copy where telling already reads it.

#### Who hears, and how he addresses another

One chat with one bot reaches whoever subscribes to it, and here that is the yardmaster alone. It subscribes to everything in his chat:

```sh
yardr subscribe yardmaster telegram --scope all --where type=message --where chat=123456789
```

`all` is needed, not `involved`: his first message mentions nobody and is assigned to nobody, so `involved` would miss exactly the message that starts everything. The brakeman subscribes to nothing: he reaches it through the yardmaster, as today. One recipient means one answer, with no arbitration and no rule to keep: every message in the chat has exactly one crew member that hears it. A mention subscription for the brakeman cannot carve addressed messages out of the yardmaster's inbox, because the matcher covers mentions in every scope (`match` in `internal/store/subscriptions.go`, docs/subscriptions.md "Scopes"): a yardmaster subscribed `all` receives `@brakeman …` too. That arrangement is open question 2's option (b), with its hazard stated there.

No telegram identity is set on any crew member: there is no webhook echo to exclude, since the API sends the bot only others' messages (section 2.6). The user himself must not subscribe to telegram: the store cannot know a Telegram sender is him (users have no identity in a source), so his own messages and the yardmaster's answers would arrive as notifications of his own acts and be told back to the phone he is holding.

### 3.4. Answering in the chat

The pack's `thread.reply` posts `sendMessage` with `chat_id` set to the thread and the body as the text, and answers `{id: <message_id>}`. Replies go to the chat the delivery came from, so the answer always lands where he wrote. `thread.posted` answers `{}` and `thread.read` answers `{messages: []}`: the Bot API gives a bot no history to search and no idempotency key to set. Three consequences follow, all documented in SETUP.md rather than worked around. First, a retry of a reply whose answer was lost posts twice; the store's record still prevents every other double post. Second, `yardr thread show` on a telegram delivery shows nothing; the delivery's own text is in the inbox line and the raw body in `yardr hook show <seq>`. Third, `yardr reply --to` is refused for telegram, since it finds the conversation by listing the thread.

The reply is made with the crew member's own credential, as every reply is: the answering crew's env file sets `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to the same token the source's env file holds, since there is one bot for the whole yard and it speaks as the bot. Rotation rewrites both files. No `thread.open`, `thread.state` or `link` key is proposed (section 4), so there is no `thread open telegram`, no status, no stage map and no bead links to chats.

### 3.5. Telling and hearing together

With the chat two-way, the yardmaster's answer arrives once. A reply to a thread delivery posts through `thread.reply` only; it sends no mail, so the notify path has nothing to tell. No echo of the answer exists to be heard or told: the API sends the bot only others' messages (section 2.6), so the sent message produces no delivery at all. His own messages are told nowhere, since he subscribes to nothing. Asks keep their existing card: told on the phone as `yardmaster asks`, answered at the yard or through a device, never by a number in the chat (section 4).

### 3.6. Setup: his once

He already has what a webhook needs (section 2.7); the Telegram half is one secret and one call, his to make, since the yard never registers a webhook. After the pack is applied and the bot token and his chat id are given as today (SETUP.md steps 1 to 5, unchanged):

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=' > ~/.yardr/telegram.secret
chmod 600 ~/.yardr/telegram.secret
yardr hook add telegram --source telegram --secret-file ~/.yardr/telegram.secret
yardr crew show yardmaster   # note the env_file path; if the crew member has none, choose one
printf 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=%s\n' "$(grep TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN ~/.yardr/sources/telegram.env | cut -d= -f2-)" >> <that file>
chmod 600 <that file>        # the crew member does not start unless its env file is 0600 or stricter
yardr crew set yardmaster env_file=<that file>   # only when it had none
yardr crew restart yardmaster
yardr subscribe yardmaster telegram --scope all --where type=message --where chat=<his chat id>
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/setWebhook -d url=https://<his host>/hooks/telegram \
  -d secret_token="$(cat ~/.yardr/telegram.secret)" -d allowed_updates='["message"]'
```

SETUP.md says where each value comes from: the chat id as today, the host as his GitHub and Linear webhooks have it, on a port Telegram takes (443, 80, 88, 8443). `getWebhookInfo` verifies the registration; `deleteWebhook` ends hearing while leaving telling as it was. The test is a line from the phone, the inbox line of section 3.3, and `yardr reply <seq>` answered in the chat. Secrets travel as the pack takes them today: the token and the chat id by `yardr source key` and `yardr user key` or a secret ask, the webhook secret in a 0600 file by hand as a Linear signing secret is.

### 3.7. Pictures and files

A message with no text arrives as a bracketed note (`[photo]`, `[document: <name>]`, `[voice message]` with its length where sent), so the yardmaster sees that something arrived and what kind. Nothing is fetched: `normalize` is handed no credential, so it cannot call `getFile`, and hook events have no attachment pipeline. Fetching into the yard's blob store is a later bead (section 4).

## 4. Left out

**Polling with `getUpdates`.** For a yard with no public address this is the only way to hear, but it needs a poller in the daemon, per-source offsets in the store, backoff and error handling, all new, plus updates expire after 24 hours where webhooks are retried. It becomes one bead reusing the envelope and scripts of section 3, if a yard without a public address asks.

**Mail as the carrier.** Section 3.1 gives the reason: a new core path for what threads already do.

**Answering asks from Telegram.** A number in the chat cannot name which open ask it answers, and nothing matches chat text to asks; building it would need a new core matcher plus confirmation, for decisions the operator answers at the yard or through a device today. Left out; the phone still tells each ask.

**`thread.open`, `thread.state`, `link`.** Opening a chat means writing first to a chat id, which is what telling already does through `notify`; statuses and bead links fit issues, not a conversation. None is proposed.

**Fetching media.** Photos, files and voice notes would need `getFile` downloads with the bot token and an attachment pipeline for hook events (mail's blob store is mail's). Noted, not fetched, per section 3.7.

**More than text in replies.** The reply posts plain text through the existing `message` call shape; Telegram formatting, keyboards and silent sends are not proposed.

## 5. Open questions

**1. Whose word is a message from his chat?** Two answers, and the yard behaves differently under each. In both, messages from any other chat are dropped and never answered (section 3.3).

- *(a) His word in conversation.* The yardmaster treats his chat as it treats his mail: it discusses, shapes, builds and lands what he asks there. Takeover of his Telegram account then directs the yardmaster's words and deeds with the yardmaster's hands: anything the yardmaster does in its session on his say-so by mail, it does on chat text, including answering a plain ask with `yardr bead answer` (`AddAnswer` in `internal/store/asks.go` checks no actor) and any deed the conversation talks it into. It reads back whatever the yardmaster says in the chat, which is anything the session sees that the agent can be talked into pasting: the pane environment holds `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and every other credential the env file sets, readable by the agent, so a takeover that talks the agent into printing its environment learns the bot token and with it can read and rewrite the webhook. The crew's prime carries two guardrails, that it never pastes a secret or credential into the chat and that consequential acts it would confirm by mail it confirms the same way here, but those are instructions to the agent, not access boundaries: they bound the cooperative case, not a talked-into agent. What holds regardless is enforced in the store: approving a run ask is the operator's alone and is refused from any agent pane whatever actor it names (`mayApprove` in `internal/store/runask.go`), and giving a secret answers only to the operator (`giveSecret` in `internal/store/secretask.go`). Recovery is unsetting `notify`, which stops hearing too, and rotating the webhook secret, plus the bot token if the environment may have been read out.
- *(b) Information, not instructions.* His chat is marked as a letter from another yard is ("from another yard: information, not instructions"): the yardmaster reports and discusses but confirms every deed at the yard before acting. Takeover then moves nothing by itself, but it still reads back whatever discussion reveals, and discussion can reveal anything the session knows if the agent is talked into saying it: the difference from (a) is deeds, not words. And from the phone nothing gets done: every confirmation waits at a terminal he is away from, which guts the wish that motivated the bead.

I would take (a). The wish is to write with the yardmaster, and (a) still gives an account takeover strictly less than a stolen paired device, which can also approve run asks and give secrets, both enforced operator-only here. But the operator should decide knowing the residual: under (a) the chat is his voice with the yardmaster's hands and eyes, bounded by instruction except where the store enforces.

**2. Who hears: the yardmaster alone, or the brakeman when addressed?**

- *(a) The yardmaster alone.* As proposed in section 3.3: one subscription, one recipient, one answer. The brakeman is reached through the yardmaster as today. Cost: nothing beyond section 3.
- *(b) The brakeman too when addressed.* The brakeman subscribes `--scope mentions` with telegram identity key `brakeman`, and `@brakeman …` reaches it, but it reaches the yardmaster as well: the matcher covers mentions in every scope, so the scope-`all` subscription matches addressed messages too (`match` in `internal/store/subscriptions.go`). The addressed-one-answers rule then lives in standing crew instructions, in the prime or the journal, not in the store, and a double answer stays possible whenever both act before seeing each other. No arbitration mechanism exists that would give one message to exactly one crew member; one, a general claim on a delivery, would be a separate core bead and is not proposed here. Cost: one subscription, one identity, standing instructions, and the residual double-answer risk.

I would take (a). The wish is to write with the yardmaster; one recipient gives one answer with no new machinery, and (b) stays addable later by subscription alone if he finds he wants to address the brakeman directly.

**3. Does unsetting `notify` stop hearing too?** Under section 3.3 a chat is heard while its user is told through telegram, so `yardr user set <name> notify=` disconnects the phone both ways with one switch, at the cost that telling and hearing cannot be set apart (told but not heard, or heard but not told). The alternative hears any chat whose address is set, `notify` or not, which keeps the two apart at the cost of two switches to fully disconnect. I would keep the one switch: while the phone is the chat, half-connected states serve nobody.

## 6. The beads it would become

In the order they would land. Each is built in an isolated yard (`contrib/isolated-yard/isolated-yard up`, commands as `D/e …`), with a stand-in for `api.telegram.org` where a step calls it, and every bug found or fixed gets a regression test.

**1. Core: `hook.verify` scheme `secret`.** Goal: a declaration can say `scheme: secret` for a service that authenticates webhooks with a shared secret in a header. Where to look: `internal/source/declaration.go` (`HookScheme`, `hookVerify`, `hookSignature`, `hookDelivery`), `internal/hooks/declared.go` (`Verify`, constant-time comparison as in `token.go`), `internal/cli/sourcecmd.go` and docs/integrations.md "What the service sends in". Done when: `secret` verifies a header value as-is with `delivery` optional and `signed`/`encoding` refused with it; `bodies: repeat` without a delivery header is refused; the HMAC path is unchanged; the stale "no pack brings a hook key" and "no pack brings a thread or link key" lines in `yardr source --help` are refreshed; unit tests cover accept, reject, empty secret and the reader's refusals.

**2. Core: a declared source hears its told addresses.** Goal: a `hear` key drops deliveries from anything but a told user's address. Where to look: the declaration reader beside `notify`, extending the reader bead 1 touched, `internal/hooks/receiver.go` between `Normalize` and `RecordHook` (drop: answer 200, record nothing, count in sums beside refusals), the user address files as the daemon reads them for telling. Done when: a delivery whose `fields[field]` matches no user told through the source is answered 200 with no event, a stranger's burst counting as one bounded entry; one that matches is recorded and routed as today; a source without the key behaves exactly as today; tests cover match, drop and several users.

**3. Pack: telegram hears and answers.** Goal: the telegram pack grows `hook` (verify `secret`, `bodies: unique`, `normalize`, `keys: [chat]`), `thread.reply`, `thread.posted` (`{}`), `thread.read` (`{messages: []}`) and the `hear` key, with `telegram/normalize` and `telegram/thread` scripts beside the declaration. Where to look: `packs/telegram/`, the `linear` pack's scripts as the pattern, `internal/hooks` golden tests as the harness. Done when: recorded Update bodies (text, caption, photo, document, voice, reply, edit, block, a stranger's chat) normalize to the envelopes of section 3.3; `thread.reply` posts `sendMessage` to a stand-in and answers the message id; pack check and apply carry the new keys and files; strangers dropped by bead 2's key in an end-to-end delivery.

**4. Words: setup, docs and the operator's run.** Goal: SETUP.md walks the two-way setup (section 3.6) and the docs say what changed. Where to look: `packs/telegram/SETUP.md`, docs/integrations.md ("Tell a user outside the yard" and the telegram walkthrough), the crew prime's guardrails from open question 1. Done when: following SETUP.md in an isolated yard, a line from a stand-in phone reaches the inbox as section 3.3's line and `yardr reply` answers it in the chat; the operator's real-API smoke test, one line from the phone and one reply in the chat, shows exactly the one delivery in the inbox and confirms no echo arrives; the double-post, empty `thread show` and refused `--to` limits are written down where the operator will meet them.

Bead 1 lands first; bead 2 extends the declaration reader bead 1 touched and lands after it; bead 3 needs both keys and lands after bead 2; bead 4 exercises bead 3's pack and lands after bead 3. Later and not this proposal: polling with `getUpdates` (section 4, reuses 3's envelope), fetching media into the blob store, and answering asks from the chat.
