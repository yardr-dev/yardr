# Installing yardr

yardr is one static binary. There are two ways to get it: a release archive,
which needs no Go, or `go install` from a checkout. Either way it then needs
git, herdr and an agent harness beside it, and `yardr doctor` says which of
those are missing.

## From a release archive

Each release has four archives, `yardr_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` for
darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, linux/amd64 and linux/arm64. An archive holds
`yardr`, the README, and the licence (Apache License 2.0) as `LICENSE` and
`NOTICE`. `checksums.txt`, with the sha256 of each archive, is
a file of the release beside the archives, not inside them: download it with
the archive.

**The archives need a login while the repository is private.** A release
asset of a private repository is served only to an account that can read the
repository, so a plain `curl` of its address gets a 404. `gh`, logged in as
such an account (`gh auth login`), downloads it:

```sh
version=1.2.3
target=darwin_arm64        # or darwin_amd64, linux_amd64, linux_arm64
gh release download "v$version" --repo yardr-dev/yardr \
  --pattern "yardr_${version}_$target.tar.gz" --pattern checksums.txt

# verify: the line for the archive must say OK
shasum -a 256 --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt      # Linux: sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt

# unpack, and put the binary on PATH
tar -xzf "yardr_${version}_$target.tar.gz" yardr
mv yardr ~/.local/bin/     # any directory on your PATH
yardr --version            # the release's tag and revision; yardr version prints the same
```

`checksums.txt` comes from the same release as the archive, so it shows that
the download is whole, not who made it: the archives are not signed.

### macOS

The binaries are not signed with an Apple developer identity and not
notarised. The arm64 binary is signed ad hoc by the Go linker, exactly like
a `go install`ed build (`codesign -dv yardr` says `Signature=adhoc`); the
amd64 binary carries no signature at all.

What macOS does with such a binary depends on how it arrived. `gh` and
`curl` do not mark what they download, and the binary runs. A browser marks
the archive as quarantined (`com.apple.quarantine`), and an unpacker can
pass the mark on to `yardr` (Finder's does); Gatekeeper then refuses to run
it, as software Apple cannot check. Clear the mark:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/yardr
```

`xattr ~/.local/bin/yardr` lists the marks a file has; no
`com.apple.quarantine` in it means there is nothing to clear.

## With go install

From a checkout, with the Go toolchain `go.mod` names:

```sh
go install .
```

This writes `yardr` to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, which has to be on PATH.
`yardr --version`, or `yardr version`, prints its revision (`abcdef123456`,
with `-modified` for a build from a tree with uncommitted changes).

## What yardr doctor still asks for

Neither way installs anything but yardr. Run `yardr doctor`
([doctor.md](doctor.md)): it works before there is a yard and names what is
missing, with where to get it:

- **git**, on PATH;
- **herdr**, on PATH and with its server running: it runs the agents' panes
  ([herdr's server](#herdrs-server));
- **a harness**: an agent herdr starts (claude, codex, opencode, …), on PATH
  and answering its version flag. That is not yet a harness that works:
  `yardr doctor --try` makes one real call to it, which costs a model call
  and says when it is logged out ([doctor.md](doctor.md#--try-one-real-call-to-each-harness)).

A program doctor reports as not on PATH can be installed all the same: over
ssh with a command, and in a service, the shell reads no profile and lacks
what yours adds (`~/.local/bin`, where claude and codex install themselves).
Doctor asks your login shell and names the directory when that finds it.

Then run `yardr` for the onboarding ([the README](../README.md#quick-start)).
It ends in [`yardr chat`](chat.md#from-the-onboarding), talking to the
yardmaster in the terminal you ran it in.

## herdr's server

herdr on PATH is a program; what starts agents is its server. Without one
every start fails with herdr's `server_not_running`, and `yardr doctor` says
`FAULT herdr … its server is not running`.

- On a machine you sit at, run `herdr` in a terminal: it launches the
  session, and its server stays when you detach (`ctrl+b q`). `herdr server
  stop` ends it, and its panes with it.
- On a machine without a desktop, `herdr server` runs the headless server,
  which herdr's [CLI reference](https://herdr.dev/docs/cli-reference/)
  recommends for supervised or service-style setups. Run it under what keeps
  a program running there. As a systemd user unit, with the path
  `command -v herdr` prints in your login shell:

  ```ini
  # ~/.config/systemd/user/herdr.service
  [Unit]
  Description=herdr server

  [Service]
  ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/herdr server
  Restart=on-failure

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target
  ```

  ```sh
  systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now herdr
  loginctl enable-linger "$USER"     # so it runs with nobody logged in
  herdr status server                # status: running, and its socket
  ```

  The unit is an example: yardr does not write or test it, and herdr's own
  documentation is what holds for its server. A systemd unit has no profile's
  PATH; if a harness is then not found in a pane, give the unit one
  (`Environment=PATH=…`).

`yardr daemon install` installs yardr's daemon, not herdr's server.

## On a server (no desktop)

A machine reached over ssh, with nobody at a terminal of its own. The order
matters: each step is what the next one needs. An agent doing this for
someone reads [agents.md](agents.md) first.

1. **Put the programs where every shell finds them.** yardr, herdr and the
   harness have to be on the PATH of three shells: yours, a shell without a
   terminal (`ssh host yardr doctor`), and a systemd user service. The last
   two read no profile, and on many systems `~/.local/bin` is on PATH only
   through `~/.profile`. Either install into a directory all three have
   (`/usr/local/bin`), or keep `~/.local/bin` and name it where it is
   missing: `yardr doctor` says which program your login shell finds that
   the shell it runs in does not, and in which directory.

2. **Run herdr's server as a service**, with the systemd user unit under
   [herdr's server](#herdrs-server). Nothing starts an agent before it
   runs.

3. **Let your services run with nobody logged in:**
   `loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`. Without it a systemd user unit ends
   with your last ssh session
   ([configuration.md](configuration.md#login-services)).

4. **Check that the harness works, not only that it is installed.** Log in
   to it as its own documentation says, then:

   ```sh
   yardr doctor --try     # one real call to each harness: costs a model call
   ```

   `ok <harness> tried: one real call answered` is the line to wait for. A
   harness's own status is not that: on the install this part comes from,
   `codex login status` said logged in and a real call was refused.
   `--try` runs the call with stdin closed, as a service would; by hand that
   is `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check 'Reply ok' < /dev/null`
   ([the call for each kind](doctor.md#--try-one-real-call-to-each-harness)).
   It does not find a harness too old for the flags herdr starts it with:
   that shows when the yardmaster's start fails. `yardr init --start` then
   prints the last lines of its pane, and `yardr doctor` the reason of the
   last failed start. Update the harness then.

5. **Create the yard and install the daemon**, from a login shell (an ssh
   session is one; `ssh host cmd` is not):

   ```sh
   yardr init --harness codex --start     # no form: flags only, see yardr init --help
   yardr daemon install                   # a systemd user unit, started now and at boot
   yardr doctor
   ```

   `yardr daemon install` writes the PATH of the shell it runs in into the
   unit, and names the programs that PATH lacks. Run it again after the PATH
   changes ([configuration.md](configuration.md#login-services)).

6. **Look at the yardmaster.** `yardr init --start` and `yardr doctor` print its
   herdr agent (`<yard>-yardmaster`, `yardr-yardmaster` for `~/.yardr`):

   ```sh
   herdr agent attach yardr-yardmaster     # its pane in this terminal; ctrl+b q detaches
   yardr chat                         # or talk to it by mail, in one view
   ```

   Both need a terminal: `ssh -t host herdr agent attach yardr-yardmaster` for
   one command over ssh.

On Linux the checksum line of [the download](#from-a-release-archive) is
`sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt`. Without `--ignore-missing` it
fails on the three archives you did not download.

This part is written from one such install (v0.1.0, Ubuntu, 5 Oct 2026) and
from herdr's documentation. yardr's tests run on no machine without a
desktop.

## A yard somewhere else

One install serves any number of yards: each is a directory, its home, and
`--home <dir>` on a command names it, with no variable to set:

```sh
yardr --home ~/yards/work                         # the onboarding, in a terminal
yardr --home ~/yards/work init --harness claude   # or scripted
yardr --home ~/yards/work doctor
yardr --home ~/yards/work daemon install          # a login service for that yard
```

Keep the directory's path short (the server's unix socket lives in it, and a
home too long for one is refused). A yard that takes webhooks next to another
needs an address of its own: `yardr --home ~/yards/work settings set
hook_addr 127.0.0.1:8791`
([configuration.md](configuration.md#yardrs-own-state)).

## Upgrading

Install the newer build over the old one, by either way: unpack the newer
archive and move `yardr` to where the old one is, or `go install` again. The
server and daemon notice the new file and replace themselves
([configuration.md](configuration.md#upgrading)). The two ways mix: a release
archive replaces a `go install`ed build of an earlier commit, and the other
way round.

## Making a release

`contrib/release/build <version> [out-dir]` builds the four archives and
`checksums.txt` (into `dist/` by default) on any machine with Go: it
cross-compiles without cgo, stamps the version, and runs the binary for the
machine it is on to check the stamp. It refuses a tree with uncommitted or
untracked files.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the depot's tests and then that script when
a tag `v*` is pushed, and creates the GitHub release with the files; a tag
with a pre-release part (`v1.2.3-rc.1`) makes a pre-release. Started by hand
(Actions, "release", "Run workflow") it is a dry run: the same tests and
build, the archives kept for a week as the run's `dist` artifact, and no
release.
